      <h1 class="post-title">Werner Erhard&#39;s Big Idea</h1>
      <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2017</span>
<p>Have you ever heard of the Landmark Forum? It&#39;s an organization that, in
exchange for a few days of your time and ~500$ promises to <em>redefine what&#39;s
possible</em> and <em>transform your life</em>.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t sound good, does it?</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs">Tiago Forte</a>, whose insight-fu is over 9000, had <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/828115457613795328">a lot of praises</a>
for it. Moreover he seemed to have overcome similar reluctance towards the
forum&#39;s pitch.</p>
<p>I was intrigued, so I set out to do a little bit of research.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>I started looking around the net for information, and finally selected a few
pieces of writing as most likely to provide insight into what the Landmark Forum
teaches.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/stream/WernerErhardOnTransformationAndProductivityAnInterview/Revision#page/n1/mode/2up">An archived interview of Werner Erhard, the forum&#39;s founder</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wernererhard.net/standardtraining.html">A description of the training from his own website</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.wernererhard.net/alter.html">A discussion between Erhard and members of the Center for the Study of New
Religious Movements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To provide some context: the Landmark Forum used to be call the <em>Erhard Simars
Training (est)</em> after its founder Werner Erhard. Erhard is no longer associated
with the forum, but the content seems unchanged.</p>
<p>A word of warning as well: while the forum is not a cult in the litteral sense,
it is very much a cult in the pejorative sense. It is relatively secretive about
its ideas, and its (aggressive) marketing practice are questionable. And of
course, everyone is expected to drink the kool-aid.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, like almost every successful cult-like
productivity/self-improvement movement (The Secret, Tony Robbins, Bulletproof
etc), it turns out the forum is build around a few solid core ideas, that are
worth taking in.</p>
<p>The first two pieces above provide a good window into those ideas. The third
document is an interesting counterpoint that shows how much bullshit can be
accreted around these ideas (there is ample warning in the other documents,
though).</p>
<h2 id="the-ideas">The Ideas</h2>
<h3 id="you-are-not-your-thoughts">You are not your thoughts</h3>
<p>The first idea is that you are not your thoughts. This is a well-known idea,
being one of the basic tenets of Zen.</p>
<p>What is the self? Some may say it is the body. Yet with sufficiently advanced
(yet realistic) science, you could replace every part of you body (except
perhaps the brain) and still be you. Some may says it is the mind. That&#39;s just
begging the question: what is the mind? Is it your thoughts, your points of
view, your emotions or your personality? Your thoughts change all the time; and
people have been known to change their personalities and their outlook on life
completely, yet we still acknowldge them as the same person.</p>
<p>The key concept is continuity. You are not your thoughts or emotions, but a
container (and a source) for them. The contents of the container may change, but
the container endures. Under that view, our memory is a curated log of
everything that went inside the container.</p>
<p>This may seem rather obvious. Yet we rarely think about the possibilities that
this affords us. The possibility to change our thoughts completely, as we see
fit. This is in fact, the big idea.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-idea-changing-paradigms-of-thought">The Big Idea: Changing Paradigms of Thought</h3>
<p>A paradigm of thought is a way of thinking. In the container metaphor, a
paradigm of thought is how we can change what&#39;s inside the container, and how we
can make it evolve. Essentially, changing the way you think (<em>how</em> you think,
not <em>what</em> you think). The words <em>context</em>, <em>point of view</em> and <em>perspective</em>
may be used instead of <em>paradigm</em>. I will stick with <em>paradigm</em> and
<em>perspective</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the purpose of the training to allow people to see that the
circumstances of their lives and that their attitudes about the circumstances
of their lives exist in a context or a system of knowing, and that it is
possible to have exactly the same circumstances and attitudes about these
circumstances held in a different context, and that, as a matter of fact, it
is possible for people to choose their own context for the contents of their
lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Point of view</em> does not mean <em>opinion</em>, it means <em>perspective</em>. A different
point of view means a different vantage point from which the same thing can be
observed from a different angle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They no longer are their point of view. They have one, and know that the one
they have is the one they chose, until now, and that they can, and probably
will, choose to create other points of view. They experience, that is, that
they are the one who defines the point of view, and not the reverse. They
experience the intended result of the training, which is a shift in what
orients people&#39;s being from the attempt to gain satisfaction - a deficiency
orientation - to the expression of satisfaction already being experienced - a
sufficiency orientation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adopting a different perspective (a <em>paradigm shift</em>) is not meant to change
objective assessments (facts or scientific truths) but rather subjective
assessments (opinions). Because a different perspective approaches matters from
a different angle, information is added. This may or may not cause you to revise
your opinion, but in all cases your understanding of the object increases.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to suggest there are multiple systems to arrive to truth. There is
one good system to arrive to truth, and it&#39;s called <a href="https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/">rationality</a>. Paradigm
shifts are tools for rational thinking and for rational action.</p>
<p>In essence, paradigms afford possibilities, and adopting new paradigms will
reveal possibilities that were closed before. One way it does so is by loosening
constraints, in particular opinions about the self:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 3 main ideas are giving up narratives, letting go of blaming, &amp; separating
all the labels we put on ourselves, from our selves. (<a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/828119037762641920">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the next 3 days, I did indeed have one of the most impactful experiences
of my life. I may write about it at length another time, but the short version
is that I learned what I didn’t know I didn’t know. I was shown my blindspots:
my interpretations of what had happened in my past, of my family and past
relationships, of life and how it works, were slowly and then quickly peeled
apart from the reality they tried to describe, like peeling apart two
tortillas that you felt sure were one. I came to see — not just understand
theoretically — that I had confused my “self” with a persona that I had
created. I had created it to survive, to get by, to solve a small set of
problems I happened to have at a certain formative period of my life. And now
I was facing problems that persona was not equipped to manage. It was creating
problems instead of solving them, and I had to let it go. (<a href="https://medium.com/praxis-blog/the-secret-praxis-master-plan-356280c9d8ef#.5yzn2edn1">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paradigm shifts can help you understand other people, by figuring out which
perspectives they assumed (and which they did not). The ability to convince or
inspire other people is often a huge factor of success, and adopting new
perspectives can help with that.</p>
<p>Note that you can&#39;t convince someone by giving them facts or opinions. Instead
you have to change their perspective as well. Easier said than done, but it does
suggest a more indirect (almost socratic) method than is usually employed. The
high level overview is to reframe the discussion to align it with the
perspective you want the other persone to assume. This is not unlike how polls
can be manipulated by rephrasing the question.</p>
<p>Adopting a new perspective also changes the way your subconscious (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems">System 1</a>
from <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>) reacts to happenstances. This is important
because it is hard to impact your subconscious reactions deliberately (that
would entail re-routing them through the conscious mind), and yet these
reactions are key, both in personal motivation and mood, but also in
inter-personal relations.</p>
<h3 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h3>
<p>An interesting thing to fall out of this is <em>responsibility</em> for one&#39;s own
experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet, the experience of responsibility for one&#39;s own experience is the
awareness that I am the source of my experience. It is absolutely inseparable
from the experience of satisfaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, if I am not responsible for (the source of, the cause of) my
experience of the predicaments in my life, then I can only resist, fix, change,
give into, win out over, or dominate. Paradoxically, the experience of
helplessness or dominance results from the attempt to locate responsibility
outside of self and sets up a closed system out of which it is sometimes very
difficult to extricate a valid experience of self; since the self which might
otherwise be responsible has been excluded in the attempt to protect it from
guilt, shame, blame, burden and fault.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a caricature, but rather a paradigm shift from being a passive
sufferer to &quot;what can I do about it?&quot; / &quot;how can I alter my perception of it?&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sometimes asked whether I &#39;really&#39; mean that people are wholly responsible
for their experience of life, as if I wished to blame people in poor
circumstances. Responsibility, in my view, is simply the awareness that my
universe of experience is my own including the experiences of those events in my
life I call accidents.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fuzzyness">Fuzzyness</h2>
<p>The notion of what constitutes paradigm is deliberately fuzzy.</p>
<p>As I wrote this article, I tried to pin it down but all my examples were either
too specific or silly-sounding.</p>
<p>Erhard also does not give a precise definitions in his writings. What <em>I expect</em>
is that the training gives a boatload of them, without ever pointing out &quot;hey,
this is a paradigm of thought&quot;, but rather letting the association be done by
osmosis.</p>
<p>Leaving the definition fuzzy is rather useful: it lets people project all kind
of things onto these paradigms. Think that are likely to help them. It does not
<em>constrain</em> their view of what a paradigm should or should not be.</p>
<p>It also has the added benefit that if you do not define precisely what you are
talking about, you can never be proved wrong (something that is particularly
apparent in the discussion — the third article).</p>
<h2 id="a-grain-of-salt-experience-viscerality">A Grain of Salt: Experience &amp; Viscerality</h2>
<p>All this is subject to a big caveat. I did not attend the forum, but both Erhard
and attendees seem to insist that the <em>experience</em> of it matters, at least as
much as the ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expanding one&#39;s experience of life can only be done through an experience, not
through books and facts and knowledge. That was my blind spot.<br>...<br>But this learning has to be done live, in a group, through the experience of
going through it together. I can&#39;t fully explain why. (<a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/828117839714201600">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can understand it too: many times there was something that <em>I knew</em> but never
really practiced until it somehow clicked and acquired a new <em>visceral</em> feeling.
It shifted from being theory to being something relevant in practice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#39;m not too hot on attending the forum. What I know of it wouldn&#39;t
connect with me: I always recoil from drinking the collective kool-aid. If I see
a crowd professing something which I find questionable, System 2 kicks in high
gear and everything is viewed with suspicion. A benign example: groups or
companies where members claimed that the company was better than the others.</p>
