title: "Micro-Rant: Java Build Systems"

Ant is Make in XML.

Maven is an over-engineered, yet castrated build system. You can't do
fundamental stuff (such as specifying which version of Java you want to use or
**moving files**) without importing a plugin or calling Ant. Want to do something
slightly different? Build you own plugin (this process is more painful than it
sounds). On the plus side, Maven does have a handy (but not best-in-class)
dependency system, which is why we still have to suffer it.

Gradle allows custom build tasks (**finally!**). It's also huge, bloated, and
comes with a [70-chapters manual][gradman] that still manages to be lacunary and
confusing. Understanding Gradle is not the work of an afternoon but of weeks.

Scala is not served better. To think sbt once stood for "simple build
tool" (now retconned to "scala build tool") is enough to choke on the irony.

[One might as well build Java using Make.](/build-java-with-make)

## Hope?

[Kobalt][kobalt] is a sane build system for Kotlin & Java by Cedric Beust (the
author of TestNG). However it's still in its infancy.
  
[pluto][pluto] is a prototype from academia ([related paper][pluto-paper])
that enables incremental, minimal, and safe builds (no need to `make clean`).
You can't really use it as is, but the idea only asks to be picked up.
