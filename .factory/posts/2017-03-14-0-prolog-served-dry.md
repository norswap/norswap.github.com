I believe there should be more programming books targetted at experienced
programmers. In particular, it seems like most books about programming
languages go to great lengths to be accessible to beginners.

But this is actually detrimental to the experience of the experienced
programmer, who either wants to get up and running with the language as fast as
possible, or to understand what makes the language tick.

Most of the time, I'm firmly in the second category: I want the mental models
and implentation details underlying the language. Those are of paramount
importance to reach proficiency with the language, yet they are rarely taught
explicitly.
 
At the start of this year, I actually was in a position to do something about
this, as I needed to design the lab sessions for our Programming Language
Paradigms course. While the (master) students are not exactly *experienced* in
the traditional sense, they already have at least 3 languages under their belts
and are quite capable of handling what we throw at them.

The first language we cover is Prolog. There are three lab sessions on the topic
and I have now made them available [on Github][prolog-labs].

If you're interested in Prolog, give them a spin. You might find them
interesting, maybe not all that easy, and – I hope – enlightening.
