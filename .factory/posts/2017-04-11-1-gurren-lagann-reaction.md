I just watched the anime [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann]. And: oh. my.

Admittedly I'm almost exactly 10 years late to the party. But if you are too and
have no prejudice against anime**\***, do yourself a favour and watch it;
especially if you sometimes struggle with motivation.

The anime is completely over-the-top, but somehow it all works out beautiful.
It's an ode to fighting spirit, and the force of will. It's pure motivation
cranked out to 10. I know it will stay with me a long time.

**\*** Anime is probably one of the most inventive medium currently out there. I
really should write about it sometimes. It was prejudiced against it enough in
my youth that I didn't explore it. I could say I regret it, but I prefer to
think it's just more good stuff to feed on now.
