title: "What I've Been Up To"
---

Been a while! What I've been to since July, in no particular order:

- I visited [Tokyo] & [Ireland].

- I improved the program that generates this website, it now does incremental
  generation, and I have a post in the works about it.

- I started writing my thesis, and got a good headstart.

- I finished my re-read of the first 13 books of [The Wheel of Time], and my first
  read of the 14th and final book. (I must have read 3 of them since July.) I
  thought of writing about it, but the series means so much to me ([I'm not the
  only one][tweet]), I'm afraid not to do it justice. I must also recoup my
  thoughts about it.

  Did you know Amazon is adapting it into a TV show? Might use that as an excuse
  to re-read and write about it.

- I've kept [lifting weights], I'll write some thoughts about it soon.

- I'm now reading [8 Years in Azeroth], the account of player Hanzo as he leads
  his guild \<Descendants of Draenor\> through the first eight years of World of
  Warcraft.

- I've started tracking my sleep using the [sonar tech] of the application
  [Sleep as Android]. I've used that as an incentive to get my average time in
  bed to 8 hours / night over the past month.
