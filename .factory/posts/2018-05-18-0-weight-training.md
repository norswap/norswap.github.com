title: "Starting Weight Training"

I've been weight training for a bit less than two months and I wanted to report
on my experiences doing that.

First a word on my background: I didn't use to be very sporty — nor fit — until
about five years ago, when I started exercising each day or every other day
(depending on the period). I did very light exercising, usually not more than 15
minutes per day, and mostly focusing on pushups and crunches. Last year I also
added pullups and chin-ups into the mix.

Despite this regimen not being very stringent — even exercising every day, it's
less than 2 hours per week — I achieved a nice level of fitness. I wouldn't have
won any strength contest, but I didn't look too bad naked and I wasn't
completely weak. Being regular is winning, no matter how little you do.

Onto the weight training then. Like many things I do, it started as something I
was curious about and wanted to experiment with. I kinda fancy the idea of
getting ripped and strong, and I wanted to see what kind of results I could
achieve by training seriously but parsimoniously (in terms of time spent).

I asked for advice on the [Slate Star Codex] Discord channel, here was my
request:

People ended up recommending the [Stronglifts] program, and I was immediately
drawn to it. First, because it's very simple: you alternate two workouts, each
consisting of three exercises: squats, bench press, barbell row; and squats
(again), overhead press, deadlifts. All those are full body strength exercises.
Second, the proper forms for the exercises is outlined in great detail on the
website. I didn't take this into account when I picked the routine, but the
companion mobile mobile app is super handy.

The routine is mostly made up of [powerlifting] / [weightlifting] moves.
Pointedly, it's not [bodybuilding]: the emphasis is on strength, not on size.
This is great: I did not want to end up huge.

By the way, you might be wondering how there might be such a distinction:
doesn't voluminous muscles entail strength? Can one be strong without size?

First things first. Bodybuilders *are* strong, but not in the same way that
powerlifters are. They probably can't lift as heavy. On the other hand,
powerlifters would probably be hard pressed to perform some of the bodybuilders'
routines (a lot of reps at high intensity, often targeting isolated muscles).
And of course, powerlifters have size, just much less than bodybuilders.

The second part of the explanation, I will lift straigth from
[Wikipedia][growth]:

So, results?

![Graph of weight lifted over time.](weights.png)

As you can see in the above graph, I progressed nicely over the last seven
weeks. Of course, the program makes you start light — although I actually
cheated and upped the weights during my first session until I felt at least a
trace amount of effort. It's possible I could have lifted more from the get go,
but you want to go progressively to develop proper form. It's also pretty
encouraging to see yourself progressing, especially when you break through small
plateaus.

I intend to continue on this trajectory, at least until I raise some arbitrary
goals. I picked the beginner goals from [this page][lifting-goals]: 1.2x
bodyweight (bw) on squat, 0.9bw on bench press, 1.5bw on deadlift and 0.6bw on
overhead press. Since I'm currently at 80kg, that's 96kg on squat, 72kg on bench
press, 120kg on deadlift and 48kg on overhead press. When I reach these
milestones, I intend to re-evaluate the training regimen. I think temporarily
switching to some bodybuilding routine might actual be beneficial if I want to
progress on the Stronglifts program. I'll have to research it, but it's probably
worth a try anyway.

All is not rosy though. The program advertises that it can be completed in ~45
minutes, but if I don't shirk at all, it's taking more like 1.5 hours. Add to
that the time from and to the gym and to shower, and I'm now spending 6 hours
each week exercising (up from less than two previously). This is bothersome for
me, and once I reach a certain level, I will need to research if there is a way
to keep the strength while drastically cutting the time spent exercising.

A few other things I want to mention: muscle memory, progressive overload and
supplements.

**Muscle memory** is a big reason why I considered weight training in the first
place. Otherwise, if you think about it, you spend time building something you
have to maintain forever afterwards. Because of muscle memory even if you reduce
or forego your training, you still benefit long term by being able to reach your
old condition much faster the next time around.

Muscle memory is not totally well understood, but the [prevalent
hypothesis][musclemem] is that:

> Previously untrained muscles acquire newly formed nuclei by fusion of
> satellite cells preceding the hypertrophy. Subsequent detraining leads to
> atrophy but no loss of myo-nuclei. The elevated number of nuclei in muscle

>  
> On subsequent detraining, the fibers maintain an elevated number of nuclei
> that might provide resistance to atrophy; on retraining, a gain in size can be
> obtained by a moderate increase in the protein synthesis rate of each of these
> many nuclei, skipping the step of adding newly formed nuclei. This shortcut

> training of individuals with no previous training history.

Remember *myofibrillar muscle growth* from earlier? Well:

So apparently myofibrillar growth leads to more nuclei and so to more muscle
memory. (Again, the science doesn't seem too well established, somewhat
suprisingly.)

**Progressive overload** is the principle on which the Stronglifts is based.
Basically you keep the same number of repetition but you add more weight each
time you succeed with your current weight. Your body adapts and learns to lift
stronger and stronger weights. Theoretically, you could also do this by
increasing the number of repetitions instead.

A regret I have is not being more serious about my home training before
switching to weight training. I feel like if I had tracked how many pullups /
chin-ups / pushups I was able to do and tried to consistently do more
(progressive overload), I could have improved my condition quite a bit without
the hassle of going to the gym.

Finally, **supplements**. I take two supplements: proteins and creatine. These
are the only two that I found offer really clear-cut benefits.

You don't need to supplement proteins, but you have to eat enough of them.
Research indicates you need about 1g per kilo of bodyweight for maintenance, and
some researcher say 1.8g per kilo of bodyweight is enough for optimal muscle
growth. Other sources suggest as much as 2 to 3g per kilo for optimal muscle
growth. Interestingly, it's never a problem to take too much proteins: they
simply get evacuated if they weren't absorbed after a certain time.

Anyway, I weight 80kg. This means I need at least ~160g of proteins if I want to
get as much muscle growth as I can. Meat contains about 25% of protein by
weight. For other types of food it varies, some vegetables have as much as
10/15% but those aren't the most common. Cheese has about 25%, eggs have 15%,
yogurt has 10%, etc. The most proteins I tend to get is about 60g of proteins
from a burrito at noon, and 50g of proteins from 200g of meat in the evening,
with a deficit of about 50g of proteins. On many days, I'm not even there. So I
supplement. I take 30g of proteins per day as a shake. If you did the math, you
notice I should probably take more. Truth be told I hadn't realized... That's
why you do the math. Also the thing tastes incredibly foul, that's some
anti-motivation right there.

A short digression on caloric intake. I found that lifting didn't really allow
me to increase my caloric intake all that much. And of course, disappointingly,
you can be as muscular as you want, if you're fat, the muscles won't show. At
the same time, running a high caloric deficit is detrimental to muscle growth:
the body break down muscle as well as fat for energy. To lose fat while gaining
muscle one has to run a **slight** caloric deficit. Easier said than done.
[Intermittent fasting][fasting], which I was already practicing, can apparently
help.

The other supplement I take is creatine which has [well-researched][creatine]
(but slight!) effects on muscle growth and a slew of other good things (reduced
fatigue, increased power output).

By the way I found the website [examine.com] to be invaluable when researching
supplements. It cross-references scientific studies on substances and present
the results in an easy-to-parse way. Much recommended.

I investigated a few other supplements besides those (BCAAs, Beta-Alanine) but
none of them seemed to offer clear enough benefits to justify the tedium.

Before I wrap this up, a few more points of feedback. I never hurt myself while
training, and I don't even feel sore after training. This was a pleasant
surprise. I did experience some knee pain from heavy squatting, which indicated
that I was leaning too much forward when doing my squats, making my knees pick
up work that should have been done by my hips. I corrected my form and I'm now
doing much better. I also had really bad forms on my first few series of dumbell
row and deadlifts, which I could immediately tell from back strain.

Finally, besides what I already recommended ([Stronglifts], [examine.com]), the
only other resource I would recommend is [Jeremy Ethier's Youtube
channel][ethier]. Not that I found anything truly crucial there, but it's
interesting, well explained and well researched.

Anyway, that was it for the experience report. Have fun training, or whatever
floats your boat :)
