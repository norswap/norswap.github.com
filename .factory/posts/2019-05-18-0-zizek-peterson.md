title: "The Zizek Peterson Debate"
---

Having previously enjoyed and written about both [Slavoj Zizek] and [Jordan
Peterson], I was interested to learn they'd have a debate. Billed as "The Debate
of the Century", its official title was "Happiness: Capitalism vs. Marxism".

Having watched it ([video]), I regret to inform you it was neither of those
things. But I nonetheless found it interesting.

The debate can best be seen as a collection of interesting ideas from both
authors with occasional bridges being thrown accross.

## Petereson's Opening Statement

[(Video Timestamp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4&t=899s)

Peterson opens with a 30-minutes speech where he criticizes the communist
manifesto, which he'd re-read for the occasion. I'd say his criticism is
essentially well-placed, *but* as many are [quick to point out][studebaker],
attacking the manifesto isn't perhaps attacking Communism or even Marxism as its
strongest point. Still, that criticism would be salutary for most "communists"
I've talked to (which, unfortunately were more fanboys than rigorous
intellectuals). Another issue is that it's hard to pin down what communism *is*
with its constellation of thinkers. At least Marxism is closed off now that Marx
is dead and he never amended his manifesto that I know of.

I was surprised (and a bit disappointed) that Peterson didn't seem more
knowledgeable about communism. He makes a big deal out of how he obsessed about
the cold war, and it would seem to me that understanding the ideological roots
of the Soviet Union would be pretty important. Similarly, he's crusading against
"post-modern neo-marxists" and it's strange not to understand or at least know
your opponent's ideas.

The statement has some interesting ideas though, including the statement that
"almost all ideas are wrong".

## Zizek's Opening Statement

[(Video Timestamp)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsWndfzuOc4&t=2776s)

Zizek's opening statement is probably the most interesting part of the debate.
You can find a transcript of it [here][transcript]. In typical Zizek fashion,
it's made of many idea nuggets only tenuously linked to one other — although
there is a link, all the more difficult to follow in the spoken form.

Zizek makes many interesting points. First, on how happiness is often the wrong
yardstick:

> In our daily lives, we pretend to desire things which we do not really desire,
> so that ultimately the worst thing that can happen is to get what we
> officially desire. So, I agree that human life of freedom and dignity does not
> consist just in searching for happiness, no matter how much we spiritualise
> it, or in the effort to actualise our inner potentials. We have to find some
> meaningful cause beyond the mere struggle for pleasurable survival.

Second on how modernity is characterized by the absence of authority (and
divinity) that could impose meaning from above, and how it's impossible to go
back to this pre-modern state of affairs.

He sees the rejections of some systemic failures of capitalism onto external
causes (from Donald Trump to migrants).

His thoughts on social constructionism vs evolutionary psychology (comparing
them, of all things, to French cuisine) are also worth a listen/read.

What's perhaps most surprising is that Zizek doesn't defend Marxism, which he
squarely throws under the bus as failed. He doesn't do much to defend Communism
either, but points a problem with capitalism on what Marx called "commons" (I
wrote [about commons] before). Capitalism threatens the commons due to its
self-reproducing nature, though he points out that communism had this
self-reproducing nature to ("the historical necessity of progress towards
communism", though — fittingly — this drive was much more centralized).

In fact, this was a surprise for many, but both men tended to agree a whole lot,
with only surface differences (some, though not all, could be chalked to their
vastly different backgrounds). The tone of the debate was also noted to be very
cordial and respectful, something I really appreciated.

Zizek's conclusion is, in his words "pessimistic": we will continue to slide
towards disaster, maybe some catastrophes can shake us out of our ruts.

I encourage you to [watch the video][video] or [read the transcript][transcript]
(or both), this part is the most interesting.

I'd say this reminds me a lot of what I've [seen from him][Slavoj Zizek]
already. Some idea make a reappearance, other are newly developed, but it's
clear these are coherent thoughts from the same thinker.

## Further Comments

The rest of the debate was (if memory serves) also interesting, but it gets even
more disjointed. Zizek was hard to follow in his prepared statement, he becomes
increasingly erratic in the rest of the debates. It's funny to see Peterson
almost sweating from concentration trying to discern a thread.

Like I said before, I appreciated immensely that both men seemed pretty much on
agreement (as well they should, adopting neither deluded far-left or far-right
opinions), and that the debate was cordial, even mutually admirative at times.

It's also *entertaining* to watch, and I suspect this was the mode in which most
people consumed the debate.

Peterson is his usual intensely-driven professorial self, which I personally
enjoy — while Zizek is his tick-ridden idiosyncratic self. He's also quite
semi-intentionally quite funny. It's hard not to crack up when — out of time for
his remarks, he starts telling a Slovenian joke, then after the first sentence
interrupts himself to add "I will finish immediately" before finishing the joke.

If you're curious, here's [the timestamp for the joke][joke].

Regarding how the debate was receiving, judging from Twitter and some quick
google, pretty well on the center-right, and pretty badly on the left (broadly).

A good criticism is the one made [by Benjamin Studebaker][studebaker]. His
argument abbreviated:

> There are three necessary features which distinguish a bad Marx paper:
> 
> 1. The paper contains a close reading of the Manifesto.
> 2. The paper contains almost no references to any other texts, either by Marx or by other socialist thinkers.
> 3. The paper contains a long digression about all the reasons the Soviet Union was terrible. I call this the “tankie-bashing” bit.

[The article][studebaker] also has a nice summary of Peterson's opening
statement.

His charge against Peterson's argument is followed with how he thinks Zizek
should have replied to defend communism. It's quite interesting, but it's not
what the debate ended up being.

Other commentators [opted for snide], which I think is sad — although the linked
live commentary *is* quite funny.

Other than that, multiple commentators ([one], [two]) pointed that the "Debate
of the Century" was overhyped (overmarketed, really), and seemed poorly prepared
by its protagonists. And I must agree. Zizek is particularly culpable here, for
talking about wherever he felt like that was tenuously related rather than
sticking to "his camp", but I feel like the resulting discussing ended up more
interesting because of it.

And sure, the level of the discussion might have been unappealing to all the
critcial theorists that were widely read. But precisely due to the marketing,
this event had the possibility to reach a much wider audience. And if you think
something wrong was said therein, you ought to engage the content rather than
ridiculing the form.

Ultimately, [make your own opinion][video].
