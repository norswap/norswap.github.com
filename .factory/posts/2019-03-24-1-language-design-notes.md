title: "Language Design Notes"
---

I'm starting a new series on (more or less) disjointed notes on programming
langauge design and related concepts.

This is the work-in-progress index to the series, which also gives a bit more
context about each post.

### [0. A Map of Polymorphism](/polymorphism)

The original impetus for the series was to write about a couple ideas I had for
language design. The first idea was to use [typeclasses] extensively, but freed
of their Haskell shackle.

As a way to introduce the topic, I wrote an overview of the different types of
polymorphisms. This ended up quite disjointed from what I have now written on
typeclasses (I'm not done yet). Nevertheless, it's not too shabby as a reference
on polymorphism, so here goes!
