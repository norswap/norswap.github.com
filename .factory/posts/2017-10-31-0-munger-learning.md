This is post 3/4 in [a series about Charlie Munger's wisdom](/munger).

---

> My habit of committing far more time to learning and thinking than to doing is
> no accident.

---

> More important than the will to win is the will to prepare.

---

**Acquire Wordly Wisdom**

---

> Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up.
> Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step by step you get ahead, but not
> necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast
> spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day – if
> you live long enough – most people get what they deserve.

---

> Acquire worldly wisdom and adjust your behavior accordingly. If your new
> behavior gives you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group... then
> to hell with them.

---

**Read a Lot**

---

> In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter
> area) who didn't read all the time - none, zero. You'd be amazed at how much
> Warren reads - and at how much I read.
>  
> If it is wisdom you’re after, you’re going to spend a lot of time on your ass
> reading.

> We read a lot. I don’t know anyone who’s wise who doesn’t read a lot. But
> that’s not enough: You have a to have a temperament to grab ideas and do
> sensible things. Most people don’t grab the right ideas or don’t know what to
> do with them.

---

> I insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and
> think. That is very uncommon in American business. I read and think. So I do
> more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most people in
> business. I do it because I like this kind of life.  
> — Warren Buffett

**Learn The Easily Learned Principles**

---

> I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever
> figured out. I don’t believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up
> yourself. Nobody’s that smart.

---

> It never ceases to amaze me to see how much territory can be grasped if one
> merely masters and consistently uses all the obvious and easily learned
> principles.

---

> Take a simple idea and take it seriously.

---

> I am a biography nut myself. And I think when you're trying to teach the great
> concepts that work, it helps to tie them into the lives and personalities of
> the people who developed them. I think you learn economics better if you make
> Adam Smith your friend. That sounds funny, making friends among the eminent
> dead, but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had
> the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life and work better
> in education. It's way better than just giving the basic concepts.

---

**Idea Destruction**

---

> We all are learning, modifying, or destroying ideas all the time. Rapid
> destruction of your ideas when the time is right is one of the most valuable
> qualities you can acquire. You must force yourself to consider arguments on
> the other side.

---

> The ability to destroy your ideas rapidly instead of slowly when the occasion
> is right is one of the most valuable things. You have to work hard on it. Ask
> yourself what are the arguments on the other side. It’s bad to have an opinion
> you’re proud of if you can’t state the arguments for the other side better
> than your opponents. This is a great mental discipline.

---

> Any year that passes in which you don’t destroy one of your best loved ideas
> is a wasted year.

---

> When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what could be better than
> to swap it for your old, less useful tool?

---

**Every Experience is a Chance To Learn**

---

> Life will have terrible blows in it, horrible blows, unfair blows. It doesn't
> matter. And some people recover and others don't. And there I think the
> attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every missed chance in life
> was an opportunity to behave well. Every missed chance in life was an
> opportunity to learn something and that your duty was not to be submerged in
> self-pity. But instead to utilize the terrible blow in constructive fashion.
> That is a very good idea.

---

> It is really useful to be reminded of your errors. I think Warren Buffett and
> I are pretty good at that. We do kind of mentally rub our own noses in our own
> mistakes. And that is a very good mental habit.

---

**Focus Over a Long Timespan**

---

> Concentrating hard on something that’s important, I can’t succeed at all
> without doing it. I did not succeed in life by intelligence. I succeeded
> because I have a long attention span.

---

> Simplicity is the end result of long, hard work, not the starting point.  
> — Frederick Maitland

---

> You need to have a passionate interest in why things are happening. That cast
> of mind, kept over long periods, gradually improves your ability to focus on
> reality. If you dont have the cast of mind, you're destined for failure even
> if you have a high I.Q.

---

**Learn to Fluency**

---

> The deep structure of the human mind requires that the way to full-scope
> competency of virtually any kind is learn it all to fluency, like it or not.

---

> If a skill is raised to fluency, instead of merely being crammed in briefly to
> enable one to pass some test, then the skill (1) will be lost more slowly and
> (2) will come back faster when refreshed with new learning. These are not
> minor advantages, and a wise man engaged in learning some important skill will
> not stop until he is really fluent in it.
