title: "Looking for Work"
layout: brief

I'm slated to finish my PhD thesis by September (give or take) and I've started
to look for work opportunities after that.

I have made contact with some interesting companies/institutions, but since
I have a few months left before I need to make up my mind, I thought I would
sollicit further offers.

So if you have something that might interest me, send information my way!

I'm interested in:

1. research or R&D-type work, especially on programming languages
2. senior technical positions, preferably including some management
   responsibilities
3. computer science teaching positions in higher eduction

I have uploaded my resume [here](/resume) ([PDF](/resume.pdf)).  
Be also sure to check my [Github account] and my [publications](/publications).
