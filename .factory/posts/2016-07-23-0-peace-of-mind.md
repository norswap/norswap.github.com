Over the past few months, I have been reading
[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance][zen] by Robert Pirsig. This post
collects a few quotes on one of the big idea I got out of the book, namely that
doing good work is synonymous with tending to your peace of mind.

[zen]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance

> Peace of mind isn't at all superficial [...] It's the whole thing. That which
> produces it is good maintenance; that which disturbs it is poor maintenance.
> [...] The ultimate test's always your own serenity. If you don't have this
> when you start and maintain it while you're working you're likely to build
> your personal problems right into the machine itself.
>
> The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you. [...] If the machine
> produces tranquility it's right. If it disturbs you it's wrong until either
> the machine or your mind is changed. The test of the machine's always your own
> mind. There isn't any other test.

> Sometime look at a novice workman or a bad workman and compare his expression

> difference. The craftsman isn't ever following a single line of instruction.
> He's making decisions as he goes along. For that reason he'll be absorbed and
> attentive to what he's doing even though he doesn't deliberately contrive this.
> His motions and the machine are in a kind of harmony. He isn't following any set
> of written instructions because the nature of the material at hand determines
> his thoughts and motions, which simultaneously change the nature of the material
> at hand. The material and his thoughts are changing together in a progression of

> that have prevented you from solving problems you couldn't solve before and
> introduced ugliness and clumsiness into your actions and thoughts.

> You don't have to go fishing, of course, to fix your motorcycle. A cup of
