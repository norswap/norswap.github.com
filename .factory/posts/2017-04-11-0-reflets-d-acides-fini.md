If you speak French and do not know about it yet, check out [Reflets d'Acide].
It's an humourous fantasy "mp3 saga" (apparently the proper english term is
"audio drama"). It's now finally complete (well, the first season) after more
than 10 years in the running.

It distinguishes itself from other offerings in the same vein by its subtle
humor, layered construction and masterful use of the French language. It even
uses a non-trivial amount of [alexandrines] being used. It's a bombastic love
letter to French, laid out in the least boring way possible: as a delightful
heroic fantasy tale. I still find things in there after listening to it at least
ten times.

I don't know about any English-language equivalent. At the very least, they
haven't had the same kind of impact on geek culture as Reflets d'Acide and other
sagas ([Le Donjon de Naheulbeuk], [Les Aventuriers du Survivaure],
[Adoprixtoxis]) have had in the French-speaking parts.

The closest thing I can think of is the much more recent [Pretend Wizards]. Know
any other? Let me know [in the comments].
