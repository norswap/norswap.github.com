title: "Building Java with Make"
---

In [violin][violin], I set up the build using the good old `make` tool (you might have
gathered that [I harbor no love][rant] for Java build systems).

For examples of how to perform common Java build tasks by calling command line
tools from make, [have a look at the makefile][makefile].
