      <title>A website for your project with Github</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Github has a thing called &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; that lets you publish a static HTML
website directly from your github repository. It&amp;#39;s quite handy, but I&amp;#39;m not
really convinced with the documentation. So here goes the super-duper easy guide
on how to add Github Pages to your existing project and manage it easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir pages
cd pages
git init .
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git commit --allow-empty -m &amp;quot;initial empty commit (pages)&amp;quot;
git push -u origin gh-pages
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, add &lt;code&gt;/pages/&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file for your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it does: basically it clones your repo inside the &lt;code&gt;pages&lt;/code&gt; directory and
immediately switches to an empty, commit-less branch called &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; (as
required by Github).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github simply serves any file within the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch to the brower through
&lt;code&gt;USERNAME.github.io/PROJECT/&lt;/code&gt;. If you&amp;#39;ve set up a custom domain name with
Github, this domain will be used instead of &lt;code&gt;USERNAME.github.io&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When inside the &lt;code&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; directory, you can make changes to your website, commit
them and publish them with &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cruising Blues</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Completing my series of posts about Robert Pirsig&amp;#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance&quot;&gt;Zen and the Art of motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;/stuckness-and-understanding&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/peace-of-mind&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/gumption-arete&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), here&amp;#39;s a
fantastic expert from an article of Pirsig, titled
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moq.org/forum/Pirsig/cruisingblues.html&quot;&gt;Cruising Blues and Their Cure&lt;/a&gt; and published in Esquire in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtue here comes from childhood reading about the old days of sailing ships
when young men were sent to sea to learn manliness and virtue. I remember being
skeptical about this. &amp;quot;How could a monotonous passage across a pile of water
produce virtue?&amp;quot; I wondered. I figured that maybe a few bad storms would scare
hell out of the young men and this would make them humble and manly and virtuous
and appreciative of life ever afterward, but it seemed like a dubious
curriculum. There were cheaper and quicker ways to scare people than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, however, with a boat of my own and some time at sea, I begin to see the
learning of virtue another way. It has something to do with the way the sea and
sun and wind and sky go on and on day after day, week after week, and the boat
and you have to go on with it. You must take the helm and change the sails and
take sights of the stars and work out their reductions and sleep and cook and
eat and repair things as they break and do most of these things in stormy
weather as well as fair, depressed as well as elated, because there&amp;#39;s no choice.
You get used to it; it becomes habit-forming and produces a certain change in
values. Old gear that has been through a storm or two without failure becomes
more precious than it was when you bought it because you know you can trust it.
The same becomes true of fellow crewmen and ultimately becomes true of things
about yourself. Good first appearances count for less than they ever did, and
real virtue - which comes from an ability to separate what merely looks good
from what lasts and the acquisition of those characteristics in one&amp;#39;s self - is
strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-discovery is as much a philosopher&amp;#39;s imponderable as reality, but when one
takes away the external stimuli of civilization during long ocean hours at the
helm far from any land, and particularly on overcast nights, every cruising
sailor knows that what occurs is not an evening of complete blankness. Instead
comes a flow of thought drawn forth by the emptiness of the night. Occurrences
of the previous day, meager as they may have been, rise and are thought about
for a while, and then die away to return again later, a little less compelling,
and perhaps another time even weaker, until they die away completely and are not
thought of again. Then older memories appear, of a week past, a month past, of
years past, and these are thought about and sometimes interrelated with new
insights. A problem that has been baffling in the past is now understood
quickly. New ideas for things seem to pop up from nowhere because the rigid
patterns of thought that inhibited them are now weakened by emptiness and
depression. Then in time these new thoughts wear town too, and the empty night
dredges deeper into the subconscious to tug at, loosen and dislodge old
forgotten thoughts that were repressed years ago. Old injustices that one has
had to absorb, old faces now gone, ancient feelings of personal doubt, remorse,
hatred and fear, are suddenly loose and at you. You must face them again and
again until they die away like the thoughts preceding them. This self that one
discovers is in many ways a person one would not like one&amp;#39;s friends to know
about; a person one may have been avoiding for years, full of vanity, cowardice,
boredom, self-pity, laziness, blamingness, weak when he should be strong,
aggressive when he should be gentle, a person who will do anything not to know
these things about himself - the very same fellow who has been having problems
with cruising depression all this time. I think it&amp;#39;s in the day-after-day,
week-after-week confrontation of this person that the most valuable learning of
virtue takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gumption and Areté</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;This post is part 3/3 in a series about Robert Pirsig&amp;#39;s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance&quot;&gt;Zen and the Art of
motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/a&gt;. See also &lt;a href=&quot;/stuckness-and-understanding&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/peace-of-mind&quot;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will talk about two notions that Pirsig puts forward: &lt;em&gt;gumption&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;areté&lt;/em&gt;. Gumption is originally a Scottish term, meaning &amp;quot;common sense,
shrewdness&amp;quot;, but also &amp;quot;drive, initiative&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person filled with gumption doesn&amp;#39;t sit around dissipating and stewing about
things. He&amp;#39;s at the front of the train of his own awareness, watching to see
what&amp;#39;s up the track and meeting it when it comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gumption-filling occurs when one is quiet long enough to see, hear and feel the
real universe, not just one&amp;#39;s own stale opinions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s common in people returning from long fishing trips. They seemingly have put
a lot of time for nothing, but in reality they come back with an abundance of
gumption, usually for the very same things they were sick to death of a few
weeks before. It&amp;#39;s not wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gumption is the psychic gasoline that keeps the whole thing going.&amp;quot; It is
necessary to all psychic tasks of interest. If you don&amp;#39;t have it, you might as
well not start. Similarly, its level must be monitored at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When gumption loss occur: take a long break, don&amp;#39;t rush in to make up for lost
gumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the gumption &lt;em&gt;traps&lt;/em&gt; is ego:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the untrained eye ego-climbing and selfless climbing may appear identical.
Both kinds of climbers place one foot in front of the other. Both breathe in
and out at the same rate. Both stop when tired. Both go forward when rested.
But what a difference! The ego-climber is like an instrument that’s out of
adjustment. He puts his foot down an instant too soon or too late. He’s likely
to miss a beautiful passage of sunlight through the trees. He goes on when the
sloppiness of his step shows he’s tired. He rests at odd times. He looks up
the trail trying to see what’s ahead even when he knows what’s ahead because
he just looked a second before. He goes too fast or too slow for the
conditions and when he talks his talk is forever about somewhere else,
something else. He’s here but he’s not here. He rejects the here, he’s unhappy
with it, wants to be farther up the trail but when he gets there will be just
as unhappy because then it will be “here”. What he’s looking for, what he
wants, is all around him, but he doesn’t want that because it is all around
him. Every step’s an effort, both physically and spiritually, because he
imagines his goal to be external and distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to my friend Stanislav for bringing this quote to my attention.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Areté&lt;/em&gt; is a greek notion that refers to excellence, acquired not as a duty to
others but to oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Areté implies excelling in many domains in life, a respect for the wholeness of
one&amp;#39;s life. It implies contempt for efficiency, or rather a higher idea for
efficiency, an efficiency which exists not in one department of life but in life
itself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stuckness and Understanding</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;The second big idea (1) I got out of reading
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance&quot;&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/a&gt; is how getting stuck is a
common part of most work processes, and how to deal with it. The tidbits below
are from my own notes, with some phrases lifted or paraphrased from Pirsig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;a href=&quot;/peace-of-mind&quot;&gt;First one here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting stuck is common. Getting stuck is trying to do too many things at once.
To get unstuck, separate the things and do them one at a time. Separate thinking
about what to say and saying things. Make a list of things to say in any order.
If there are too many, pick the best things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypotheses generation is the realm of quality. The difference between a good and
a bad mathematician or mechanic is the ability to select the good facts from the
bad ones on the basis of quality. The scientific method operates only after you
have an hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuckness isn&amp;#39;t the worst of all possible situations: zen buddhists go to much
throuble to induce it (through koans, meditation, etc). It&amp;#39;s called &amp;quot;begginer&amp;#39;s
mind&amp;quot;. This moment is not to be feared but cultivated. If your mind is truly
stuck, you might be much better off than when it was loaded with ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you try to hold onto the stuckness, it is bound to disappear. Your mind will
naturally and freely move toward a solution. The longer you stay stuck, the more
you see quality and it gets you unstuck every time. What&amp;#39;s getting you stuck is
frantically trying to get unstuck by rummaging through your knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuckness is the psychic predecessor of all understanding. An egoless acceptance
of it is key to understanding quality. Self-taught mechanics are often superior
to instructed ones because they can handle new situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry Truman on adminstration programs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll just try them - and if they don&amp;#39;t work &amp;mdash; why then we&amp;#39;ll just try
something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skill of the inventor is to choose the convenient facts. There is an
inconscient selection (subliminal self) where many possible but useless
facts/conventions are rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at things that ties up with the theory... then looks at things that are
very different, to gain insight. Maybe they are the same, maybe not. Select
facts with harmony and mathematical beauty in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Good Work is Peace of Mind</title>
      <description>
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve a set of instructions at home which open up great realms for the
improvement of technical writing. They begin, &amp;#39;Assembly of Japanese bicycle
require great peace of mind.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I have been reading
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance&quot;&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Pirsig. This post
collects a few quotes on one of the big idea I got out of the book, namely that
doing good work is synonymous with tending to your peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace of mind isn&amp;#39;t at all superficial [...] It&amp;#39;s the whole thing. That which
produces it is good maintenance; that which disturbs it is poor maintenance.
[...] The ultimate test&amp;#39;s always your own serenity. If you don&amp;#39;t have this
when you start and maintain it while you&amp;#39;re working you&amp;#39;re likely to build
your personal problems right into the machine itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test of the machine is the satisfaction it gives you. [...] If the machine
produces tranquility it&amp;#39;s right. If it disturbs you it&amp;#39;s wrong until either
the machine or your mind is changed. The test of the machine&amp;#39;s always your own
mind. There isn&amp;#39;t any other test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime look at a novice workman or a bad workman and compare his expression
with that of a craftsman whose work you know is excellent and you&amp;#39;ll see the
difference. The craftsman isn&amp;#39;t ever following a single line of instruction.
He&amp;#39;s making decisions as he goes along. For that reason he&amp;#39;ll be absorbed and
attentive to what he&amp;#39;s doing even though he doesn&amp;#39;t deliberately contrive this.
His motions and the machine are in a kind of harmony. He isn&amp;#39;t following any set
of written instructions because the nature of the material at hand determines
his thoughts and motions, which simultaneously change the nature of the material
at hand. The material and his thoughts are changing together in a progression of
changes until his mind&amp;#39;s at rest at the same time the material&amp;#39;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say inner peace of mind. It has no direct relationship to external
circumstances. It can occur to a monk in meditation, to a soldier in heavy
combat or to a machinist taking off that last ten-thousandth of an inch. It
involves unselfconsciousness, which produces a complete identification with
one&amp;#39;s circumstances, and there are levels and levels of this identification
and levels and levels of quietness quite as profound and difficult of
attainment as the more familiar levels of activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inner peace of mind occurs on three levels of understanding. Physical
quietness seems the easiest to achieve, although there are levels and levels of
this too, as attested by the ability of Hindu mystics to live buried alive for
many days. Mental quietness, in which one has no wandering thoughts at all,
seems more difficult, but can be achieved. But value quietness, in which one has
no wandering desires at all but simply performs the acts of his life without
desire, that seems the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve sometimes thought this inner peace of mind, this quietness is similar to if
not identical with the sort of calm you sometimes get when going fishing, which
accounts for much of the popularity of this sport. Just to sit with the line in
the water, not moving, not really thinking about anything, not really caring
about anything either, seems to draw out the inner tensions and frustrations
that have prevented you from solving problems you couldn&amp;#39;t solve before and
introduced ugliness and clumsiness into your actions and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to go fishing, of course, to fix your motorcycle. A cup of
coffee, a walk around the block, sometimes just putting off the job for five
minutes of silence is enough. When you do you can almost feel yourself grow
toward that inner peace of mind that reveals it all. That which turns its back
on this inner calm and the Quality it reveals is bad maintenance. That which
turns toward it is good. The forms of turning away and toward are infinite but
the goal is always the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zen Buddhists talk about &amp;quot;just sitting,&amp;quot; a meditative practice in which the idea
of a duality of self and object does not dominate one&amp;#39;s consciousness. What I&amp;#39;m
talking about here in motorcyele maintenance is ``just fixing,&amp;#39;&amp;#39; in which the
idea of a duality of self and object doesn&amp;#39;t dominate one&amp;#39;s consciousness. When
one isn&amp;#39;t dominated by feelings of separateness from what he&amp;#39;s working on, then
one can be said to &amp;quot;care&amp;quot; about what he&amp;#39;s doing. That is what caring really is,
a feeling of identification with what one&amp;#39;s doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the thing to do when working on a motorcycle, as in any other task, is to
cultivate the peace of mind which does not separate one&amp;#39;s self from one&amp;#39;s
surroundings. When that is done successfully then everything else follows
naturally. Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right
thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work
which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the
center of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social values are right only if the individual values are right. The place
to improve the world is first in one&amp;#39;s own heart and head and hands, and then
work outward from there. other people can talk about how to expand the destiny
of mankind. I just want to talk about how to fix a motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real cycle you&amp;#39;re working on is yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Building a static website with Ribosome and Node.js</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve transitioned the website from &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to a custom system based on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ribosome.ch/&quot;&gt;Ribosome&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn&amp;#39;t updating the website very regularly, and each
time I picked it up again, I had to spend an hour or so battling the
particularly horrible Ruby dependencies on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribosome is essentially a templating engine driven by a script language
(JavaScript, Python or Ruby &amp;mdash; I went with Javascript). It takes a js/py/rb
script as input, which also contains lines starting with a dot. The script is
run, but whenever a dotted line is encountered, it is sent to an output file. It
supports embedded expression within dotted lines, special directives to change
the file to which the output is redirected and include other files. This makes
it possible to generate your whole website from a single script
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/norswap.github.io/blob/master/.factory/generate.js&quot;&gt;have a look at mine&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I really like about Ribosome is how it respects whitespace, resulting
in really nice-looking output, unlike most templating engines (have a look at
the html for this page). It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://ribosome.ch/documentation.html#advanced-layout-management&quot;&gt;block layouting&lt;/a&gt; capability is also quite
handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also very pleased about the Node.js ecosystem. I was really easy to find
libraries to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter&quot;&gt;parse YAML front matter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked&quot;&gt;parse Markdown&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://momentjs.com/&quot;&gt;manipulate dates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/escape-html&quot;&gt;escaping html&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/tmp&quot;&gt;create temporary files&lt;/a&gt;. They were easy to use too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, updating the website was a surprisingly pleasant experience.
Ribosome in particular is great, I encourage you to try it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Java with Make</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/violin&quot;&gt;violin&lt;/a&gt;, I set up the build using the good old &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; tool (you might have
gathered that &lt;a href=&quot;/rant-java-build&quot;&gt;I harbor no love&lt;/a&gt; for Java build systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For examples of how to perform common Java build tasks by calling command line
tools from make, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/violin/blob/master/makefile&quot;&gt;have a look at the makefile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Micro-Rant: Java Build Systems</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Ant is Make in XML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maven is an over-engineered, yet castrated build system. You can&amp;#39;t do
fundamental stuff (such as specifying which version of Java you want to use or
&lt;strong&gt;moving files&lt;/strong&gt;) without importing a plugin or calling Ant. Want to do something
slightly different? Build you own plugin (this process is more painful than it
sounds). On the plus side, Maven does have a handy (but not best-in-class)
dependency system, which is why we still have to suffer it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradle allows custom build tasks (&lt;strong&gt;finally!&lt;/strong&gt;). It&amp;#39;s also huge, bloated, and
comes with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html&quot;&gt;70-chapters manual&lt;/a&gt; that still manages to be lacunary and
confusing. Understanding Gradle is not the work of an afternoon but of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scala is not served better. To think sbt once stood for &amp;quot;simple build
tool&amp;quot; (now retconned to &amp;quot;scala build tool&amp;quot;) is enough to choke on the irony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/build-java-with-make&quot;&gt;One might as well build Java using Make.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hope-&quot;&gt;Hope?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://beust.com/kobalt/&quot;&gt;Kobalt&lt;/a&gt; is a sane build system for Kotlin &amp;amp; Java by Cedric Beust (the
author of TestNG). However it&amp;#39;s still in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pluto-build.github.io/&quot;&gt;pluto&lt;/a&gt; is a prototype from academia (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.informatik.uni-marburg.de/~seba/publications/pluto-incremental-build.pdf&quot;&gt;related paper&lt;/a&gt;)
that enables incremental, minimal, and safe builds (no need to &lt;code&gt;make clean&lt;/code&gt;).
You can&amp;#39;t really use it as is, but the idea only asks to be picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Released: Violin, a human-sized Kotlin utility library</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I just released &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/violin&quot;&gt;violin&lt;/a&gt;, a small Kotlin utility library that features
simple streams and some other stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;
