      <title>Weight Training 8: Gains</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-2&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-3&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-4&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-5&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-6&quot;&gt;Six&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-7&quot;&gt;Seven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lifting&quot;&gt;Lifting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the powerlifting DUP protocol outlined in &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-7&quot;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt;,
except I lowered deadlift reps to 5x and 8x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran the protocol for approximately 14 weeks, before I was forced to stop
because the gym closed down for another coronavirus lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing wasn&amp;#39;t too unfortunate, however. My TTP (time to peek) on the bench
press and deadlift was approximately 8 weeks. I understand from the RTS
litterature that&amp;#39;s a pretty usual timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My squat however progressed more slowly. Might not have pushed myself enough,
but I&amp;#39;m very careful with squat form as it&amp;#39;s easier to fudge up. That was still
going up as I was forced to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I&amp;#39;ve hit new personal records on all big lifts (sets * reps *
weight in kg):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bench: 3x3x110, 3x6x100, 3x12x77.5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squat: 3x3x157.5, 3x6x135, 3x12x95&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlift: 3x3.185, 3x5x165, 3x8x135&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cutting&quot;&gt;Cutting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said last time I was doing all this while going on a slight cut. I&amp;#39;m not too
sure how that went. I stopped tracking my calories (which I&amp;#39;d been doing for ~2
years at that point) to save a bit of time and hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst-cast scenario was to cut ~200 calories on my three weekly workout
days, and eat at maintenance the rest of the time. This comes to 600 kcal/week,
or approximately one kilo over the duration of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I expected body recomposition (fat loss, muscle gain), I also skipped out
on weighting myself every day, but punctual measurements seem to indicate my
weight was more or less maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The progress on the lifts is mostly neural adaptation, but I think it&amp;#39;s likely
some amount of muscle gain occurred too, seemingly validating that body
recomposition did indeed occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;forward&quot;&gt;Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve started re-running home workouts. I&amp;#39;m not giving specifics, the idea is the
same as &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-6&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, but with a different exercise selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m interested in trying some bodyweight movements. I&amp;#39;ve experimented with
handstands against a wall (not too sure of my balacing skills). Also with the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.be/search?tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=dragon%20flag&quot;&gt;dragon flag&lt;/a&gt;, but I don&amp;#39;t have a good enough setup to accomodate it indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some distance to go where I want to be with my cut, so I&amp;#39;m going to
continue to cut moderately. I&amp;#39;ll be tracking again and aiming for a ~1200
kcal/week deficit at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any life advice that isn’t given to you personally is not designed to be
followed to the letter. Try to resonate with the philosophy that generates it
instead. Remember that directional advice (e.g., “be more …”) &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear/&quot;&gt;may need to be
reversed&lt;/a&gt; before consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not having fun then just leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I know we were just introduced, but I forgot your name.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I saw the email you
sent me last month, I just procrastinated and forgot.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;This is the best
effort I was realistically going to make.&amp;quot; Try it, it&amp;#39;s liberating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your spouse, friend, or family member is doing something dumb but not
strictly harmful, try thinking of it as their artistic expression instead of
using facts and logic to fail to talk them out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re home alone, blast some music and dance. Don&amp;#39;t think about your
body, just focus on the music. Then do the exact same thing when you&amp;#39;re at a
dance party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get massages, give massages. You don&amp;#39;t have to know what you&amp;#39;re doing to
make someone feel great. Use scentless baby oil, or moisturizer if the recipient
is not going to shower afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t nitpick tweets, that&amp;#39;s the opposite of good improv. - &amp;quot;But what you
wrote doesn&amp;#39;t always apply because...&amp;quot; Congrats, you got someone annoyed and now
you&amp;#39;ll just sit there getting frustrated because you expect a response and
aren&amp;#39;t going to get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop lurking; write that comment. You know the saying about letting people
suspect you&amp;#39;re dumb rather than opening your mouth and removing all doubt? Fuck
that. We know you&amp;#39;re dumb, and you get less dumb by saying things and getting
feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you really going to give up on expressing yourself, learning from
mistakes, attracting like-minded people, building a reputation, and changing the
world because someone may someday try to cancel you? They can smell the fear,
you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re moving chargers and cables around, you need to buy more chargers
and cables. A girl in every port, a USB-C in every room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors are human, they have biases and make mistakes. It&amp;#39;s your job to be
educated about your conditions and the drugs you are prescribed. If you&amp;#39;re
confused, ask for details or a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/The_Luck_Factor.pdf&quot;&gt;The Luck Factor (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky people generate their own good fortune via four basic principles. They
are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities, make lucky
decisions by listening to their intuition, create self-fulfilling prohesies
via positive expectations, and adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad
luck into good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theartofmachinery.com/2020/01/27/systems_programming_probability.html&quot;&gt;Some Useful Probability Facts for Systems Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an outcome has probability 1/N for each &amp;quot;attempt&amp;quot;, and it is attempted N
times, the probability it will occur at least once stabilizes at 0.62 as N
increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you throw N balls randomly (independently and one at a time) into N
buckets. On average, a bit over a third (1/e) of the buckets will stay empty, a
bit over a third (1/e again) will have exactly one ball, and the remaining
quarter or so (1 − 2/e) will contain multiple balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a group of things are randomly shuffled, a bit of over a third (1/e) of the
time there’ll be no fixed points (something that lands in the same position), a
bit of over a third (1/e) of the time there’ll be just one fixed point, and the
remaining quarter or so of the time there’ll be two or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the common “loot box” mechanism. Specifically, suppose there are
10 collector items (say, one for each hero in a franchise) that are sold in
blind boxes. Let’s take the fairest case in which there are no rare items and
each item has an equal 1/10 chance of being in a given box. How many boxes will a
collector buy on average before getting a complete set? This is the called the
coupon collector’s problem, and for 10 items the answer is about 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the coupon collector’s problem is a bit more than N * ln(N) (add N/2
for some more accuracy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coupon collector’s problem hints at why the loot box mechanism is so
powerful. The N balls in N buckets rule tells us that the collector will have
about two thirds of the items after buying 10 boxes. It feels like the collector
is most of the way there, and it would be a shame to give up and let so much
progress go to waste, but actually 10 boxes is only about a third of the
expected number of boxes needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1225561131122597896?s=09&quot;&gt;40 powerful concepts for understanding the world&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergodicity: A die rolled 100 times has equal probabilities to 100 dice rolled
once; rolling a die is “ergodic”. But if the die gets chipped after 10 throws
so it’s likelier to roll 4, then 1 die 100 times =/= 100 dice once
(non-ergodic). Many treat non-ergodic systems as ergodic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://larspsyll.wordpress.com/2016/11/23/what-is-ergodicity-2/&quot;&gt;another good explanation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simpson’s Paradox: A trend can appear in groups of data but disappear when these
groups are combined. This effect can easily be exploited by limiting a dataset
so that it shows exactly what one wants it to show. Thus: beware of even the
strongest correlations. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1225561191470260227&quot;&gt;illustration&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Condorcet Paradox: a special instance of Simpson’s paradox applied to elections,
in which a populace prefers candidate A to candidate B, candidate B to C, and
yet candidate C to A. This occurs because the majority that favors C is
misleadingly divided among different groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concept Creep: As a social issue such as racism or sexual harassment becomes
rarer, people react by expanding their definition of it, creating the illusion
that the issue is actually getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streetlight Effect: People tend to get their information from where it’s easiest
to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woozle Effect: An article makes a claim without evidence, is then cited by
another, which is cited by another, and so on, until the range of citations
creates the impression that the claim has evidence, when really all articles are
citing the same uncorroborated source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tocqueville Paradox: As the living standards in a society rise, the people’s
expectations of the society rise with it. The rise in expectations eventually
surpasses the rise in living standards, inevitably resulting in disaffection
(and sometimes populist uprisings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nirvana Fallacy: When people reject a thing because it compares unfavorably to
an ideal that in reality is unattainable. E.g. condemning capitalism due to
the superiority of imagined socialism, condemning ruthlessness in war due to
imagining humane (but unrealistic) ways to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spotthedrowningchild.com/&quot;&gt;It&amp;#39;s surprisingly difficult to spot someone
drowning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a dialog with a lot of questions from a student, it might sound as though the
student is nitpicking and/or challenging the teacher, when he&amp;#39;s really just
trying to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/webdevMason/status/1232406997712003072&quot;&gt;Tweet by Mason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed that many of the most persistent childhood traumas related to being
made to feel unwanted, a burden, the &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; one. I think they may persist as
&amp;quot;chronic mental illness&amp;quot; because being sick doesn&amp;#39;t heal the wound of being a
burden — being &lt;em&gt;the healer&lt;/em&gt; does&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely believe that many western communities are now suffering not for lack
of services to be received by hurting people, but for lack of services to be
&lt;em&gt;provided&lt;/em&gt; by hurting people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitive as it is, next time someone around you is struggling with
living in their own head, don&amp;#39;t ask how you can help; ask them to help you. If
they don&amp;#39;t, or they flake, just keep asking for small things. Don&amp;#39;t pressure or
punish for lack of follow-through, just ask&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not so broken that we don&amp;#39;t need you&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; is something that has to be
lived to be believed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is true that… many of our beliefs are actually &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; to our internal
world, off-loaded on to the internet, books, authorities we identify with, etc…
then it might be that the project of &amp;#39;debunking&amp;#39; is of limited value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that &lt;em&gt;identification&lt;/em&gt; with many institutions… is every bit as much a
mechanism that binds people to oppressive systems as conscious belief… a major
strategy for undermining certain social formations would consist in the question
of how to produce &lt;em&gt;disidentification&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lock-and-key approach to life: each thing it either a perfect fit or not. What
is a perfect fit changes with each past fit. TRY a lot of things and ITERATE
through trying them really fast (quit early, quit often). Don’t do anything
hard, do what effortlessly &lt;em&gt;clicks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11783&quot;&gt;Concept: Kayfabe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because professional wrestling is a simulated sport, all competitors who face
each other in the ring are actually close collaborators who must form a closed
system (called &amp;quot;a promotion&amp;quot;) sealed against outsiders. With external
competitors generally excluded, antagonists are chosen from within the promotion
and their ritualized battles are largely negotiated, choreographed, and
rehearsed at a significantly decreased risk of injury or death. With outcomes
predetermined under Kayfabe, betrayal in wrestling comes not from engaging in
unsportsmanlike conduct, but by the surprise appearance of actual sporting
behavior. Such unwelcome sportsmanship which &amp;quot;breaks Kayfabe&amp;quot; is called
&amp;quot;shooting&amp;quot; to distinguish it from the expected scripted deception called
&amp;quot;working&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Wrestling evolved out of &amp;quot;catch&amp;quot;.] Typical matches could last hours with no
satisfying action, or end suddenly with crippling injuries to a promising
athlete in whom much had been invested. This highlighted the close
relationship between two paradoxical risks which define the category of
activity which wrestling shares with other human spheres:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) Occasional but Extreme Peril for the participants.
B) General: Monotony for both audience and participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kayfabrication (the process of transition from reality towards Kayfabe) arises
out of attempts to deliver a dependably engaging product for a mass audience
while removing the unpredictable upheavals that imperil participants. As such
Kayfabrication is a dependable feature of many of our most important systems
which share the above two characteristics such as war, finance, love, politics
and science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the point Kayfabe was forced to own up to the fact that professional
wrestling contained no sport whatsoever, it did more than avoid being regulated
and taxed into oblivion. Wrestling discovered the unthinkable: its audience did
not seem to require even a thin veneer of realism. Professional wrestling had
come full circle to its honest origins by at last moving the responsibility for
deception off of the shoulders of the performers and into the willing minds of
the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kayfabe, it appears, is a dish best served client-side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27181&quot;&gt;Concept: Russell Conjugation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the theory goes, it is not that we don’t have our own opinions so much as
that we have too many contradictory ones, and it is generally our emotional
state alone which determines on which ones we will predicate action or inaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell Conjugation (or “emotive conjugation”) is a presently obscure
construction from linguistics, psychology and rhetoric which demonstrates how
our rational minds are shielded from understanding the junior role factual
information generally plays relative to empathy in our formation of opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where words can be considered “synonyms” if they carry the same factual content
(I) regardless of the emotional content (II). This however leads to the peculiar
effect that the synonyms for a positive word like “whistle-blower” cannot be
used in its place as they are almost universally negative (with “snitch,”
“fink,” “tattletale” being representative examples). This is our first clue that
something is wrong, or at least incomplete with our concept of synonym requiring
an upgrade to distinguish words that may be content synonyms but emotional
antonyms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;firm&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;obstinate&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;pig-headed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;death tax&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;estate tax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;illegal alien&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;undocumented migrant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/youre-a-slave-to-money-then-you-die/&quot;&gt;You&amp;#39;re a Slave to Money, Then You
Die&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the student and other forms of personal debt that prepare undergraduates
to say two words — &amp;quot;Yes, boss&amp;quot; — the ideal of the entrepreneurial self serves
a fundamentally disciplinary function: reinforcing the precarious nature of
work in today’s digitalized, low-wage, precariously employed, and increasingly
automated capitalism, one in which you are casually expendable and which
places a premium on everlasting metamorphosis: upgrade your skills, your
profile, your resume. But don’t worry, complain, or God help you, call a
union: losing your job or seeing your skill set rendered obsolescent is an
opportunity for &amp;quot;growth,&amp;quot; creativity, empowerment. When your own exploitation
can be recast as a project rather than a problem—a source of fulfillment
rather than an instance of injustice—then solidarity with others can be
vilified as conformism, the herd instinct of normies, the last refuge of
losers and mediocrities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/freWTrdfxwpn4imwn/the-value-is-in-the-tails&quot;&gt;The Value is In The Tails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked him why he bet on Trump, he said he didn&amp;#39;t really understand
American politics, but that it seemed extremely complicated, with random things
like whether it rains in certain parts of Pennsylvania potentially being
important. If it&amp;#39;s extremely complicated and arbitrary, then it&amp;#39;s probably also
hard to model. The projections he saw had the most likely outcome being a
moderate win by Hilary, but since he didn&amp;#39;t trust the models, he figured the
value was in the tails: the models are likely off, which likely affects the
tails more than the mean. So a landslide win by Hilary or a Trump victory seemed
undervalued by gambling markets. He wished he could hedge his bets by betting on
both outcomes (as opposed to a moderate Hilary win), but the only option he had
was to bet on Trump to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logic has stuck with me ever since: in the face of large uncertainty, we&amp;#39;re
probably getting the tails wrong more than the mean. The value is in the tails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rMfpnorsMoRwyn4iP/choosing-the-zero-point&quot;&gt;Choosing The Zero Point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can decide what state of affairs counts as neutral, and what counts as
positive or negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g. animal suffering: you can define the zero point as &amp;quot;animal shouldn&amp;#39;t suffer
more than if humans were there&amp;quot; and if you accept it, that makes you a monster.
You could frame the zero point as the current situation, and every improvement
you make as a net gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A society has the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Everyone must publicly electro-shock themselves 8 hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— If you see someone not shocking themselves then you must kill them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Anyone who violates the second rule must also be killed. The same is true for
  all meta levels. Non-killers of non-killers of ... of non-shockers must be
  killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This equilibrium can get locked in even if every single person dislikes it. I
think similar but weaker dynamics apply all the time in normal life. Why is
there so much hyperbolic hate direct against furries?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most are people are very repressed. Society has a norm that you need to keep
‘low status’ or ‘cringey’ aspects of yourself private. Furries often violate
these norms. People feel the urge to punish them. And people often feel
uncomfortable even being seen as being tolerant. Afterall tolerators are at risk
too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t claim this is the only dynamic at play. People also like to look down on
official low-status groups to feel better about themselves. Notably, even if
people don’t intrinsically want to punish non-shockers may still hate them. If
you let me see you not shocking yourself now you have put me at risk unless I
punish you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had several conversations with friends who’ve been incapacitated by the
burdensome bullshit obligation to Have A Meaningful Life / Be Remembered / Do
Important Work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me as socially inherited bloatware that causes tedious lag, which
ironically prevents you from being awesome. When people say things like “just be
yourself”, I think often what they mean is “be less laggy” – ie, uninstall the
bloatware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonderfully, it seems to me that lots of people who end up Doing Important Work
often got there by being playful and curious. Richard Feynman, for example, got
his Nobel prize from piddling around with spinning plates. And the point isn’t
to get the Nobel prize, the point is to enjoy the piddling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you
enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you’d like to
like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be too timid and squeamish about your actions. All life is an experiment.
The more experiments you make, the better. What if they are a little coarse and
you may get your coat soiled or torn? What if you do fail, and get fairly rolled
in the dirt once or twice? Up again; you shall never be so afraid of a tumble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“radical honesty” is actually pretty hard because we’re so used to language
being gamified that even if you say exactly what you feel people will
generally presume you must be implying something else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the insight that blew my mind around age 20 when I read 48 Laws of
Power. The realisation that my social relations were suffering because people
weren’t interpreting my words as honest, likely because they simply weren’t used
to dealing with someone like me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/28/creationism-unchallenged/&quot;&gt;Creationism Unchallenged&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationism was cancer and the most dangerous thing in the early 2000s. Yet
still as many people believe it. Yet we don&amp;#39;t talk about anymore, and it&amp;#39;s not
been an apocalypse. Talking about it hasn&amp;#39;t hindered or helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s the same with the issue of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see people using rivers of ink to fight the modern equivalents of
creationists. Pizzagaters, flat-earthers, moon-hoaxers, QAnon, deep-staters,
people who say the coronavirus is a bioweapon, Alex Jones. Are they sure it’s
not equally useless? Equally counterproductive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tynan.com/valuableoutput&quot;&gt;Long Term Valuable Output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to realize that what you create when you are at your best will be
many times more valuable than what you create at average or worse. Sometimes
work created can even be a net negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is one of the biggest factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also important to optimize your workspace as much as possible. Get a huge
monitor, a comfy chair, and a nice desk. Get some plants. Spend the time
customizing your computer to make it easy and efficient to use. These are basic
things but they really matter a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you sit down to work, your task must be connected to a goal that matters to
you and it must be an effective lever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are at your best and are working on something that matters, that&amp;#39;s when
it&amp;#39;s time to step on the gas and work hard. The amount of valuable output you
can create in even 4-6 hours of peak performance can be better than days or even
weeks of mediocre output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnestness will make you edgier than trying to be edgy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistence: geniuses are mostly just people who are uncommonly persistent in
pursuing their curiosities and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolificacy is a superpower: if you want to get good at something, do it 1,000
times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing anything for a long period of time (do it 100 times, do it for 10 years)
will reveal interesting things, and make you an interesting person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex: lots of people want to be fuckable more than they want to fuck. fucking is
labor, fuckability is capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People think focus means saying yes to the thing you&amp;#39;ve got to focus on. But
that&amp;#39;s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good
ideas that there are... I&amp;#39;m actually as proud of the things we haven&amp;#39;t done as
the things I have done...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Reviews 8</title>
      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tower-of-god-anime&quot;&gt;Tower of God (Anime)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;tower-of-god.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I somehow forgot to review this last time, even though it&amp;#39;s one of the shows I
enjoyed the most of the last batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an adaptation of one of the most popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/kennycomics-webtoon-101/whats-webtoonmangamanhwamanhua/viewer?title_no=5956&amp;amp;episode_no=8&quot;&gt;webtoon manhwa&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;d read the
start of it a while ago (covering much more than this first anime season).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say it&amp;#39;s a faithful adaptation which works really well. I feel like the
anime medium has the potential to clarify some stuff that is not always very
clear in the manhwa. They probably will have to simplify things a little in the
future (and maybe they already have, but things are simple enough so far that
it&amp;#39;s impercetible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anime spurred me to reread the manhwa. Actually, to read most of the
published stuff for the first time — it&amp;#39;s still being published and my first
read through was a while back. Since I just finished it, I&amp;#39;m going to say more
about the manhwa immediately. You can just assume everything transposes to the
anime as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tower-of-god-webtoon---up-to-episode-485&quot;&gt;Tower of God (Webtoon - up to episode 485)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After staying vague in the anime description, it&amp;#39;s probably fair that I tell you
a bit more about the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story centers around Bam, a boy that seemingly lived his whole life so far
in some sort of huge cave, in company of a girl called Rachel (that you will
soon come to hate). The story starts as Rachel is pulled off into &amp;quot;the tower&amp;quot;,
shortly followed by Bam — who is determined to find Rachel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tower is a whole universe, subdivided into floors, which are whole worlds
onto themselves. It is moreover subdivided between the outer tower - which is
just a collection of plain old worlds where people live, and the inner tower,
where a select few are called. Usually, people are called into the inner tower
from the outer tower, in which case they are called &amp;quot;regulars&amp;quot;. Their goal is to
climb the tower. Reaching the top seemingly makes one&amp;#39;s dream come true — or
something — but it requires powering up massively along the way in order to keep
up with the competition. Climbing itself is achieved by passing tests (elaborate
games that typically involve fighting) on each floor. Very rarely, people from
outside the tower manage to enter the inner tower and climb (like Bam and
Rachel) — these are called irregulars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strenght of the story, in my opinion, lies in the vast (very vast) crew of
colorful and interesting characters that each come with their own background and
motivations, and are deftly woven into the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comparison that I find apt is that &lt;em&gt;Tower of God&lt;/em&gt; is a bit like &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice
and Fire&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; books): it too has a ton of characters that
jump in a out of the story, and complex motivations and relationships between
the characters. I find that too often anime/manga proceed in fixed &amp;quot;arcs&amp;quot; where
you get to face the villain du jour with today&amp;#39;s allies, which are quickly
forgotten about. No so in &lt;em&gt;Tower of God&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not quite &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; either. For one, there is much less dialogue
between characters where they expose their motivations and share their life
philosophy. Most of that comes in the form of flashbacks (though oftgen
occasionally be narrated flashbacks). There are a few more quiet passages where
character really &amp;quot;converse&amp;quot; about their feeling (as opposed to just trading
information without accompanying emotional/philosophical sense-making), so the
author can write them, but they are relatively few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in my opinion is that the writing gets a bit weaker towards the end of
the currently published episodes, as the stakes expand. The story focuses less
on floor tests and more on grandiose fights. Yet, games with complex ruleset is
one of the story main&amp;#39;s shticks, and the author finds a way to reintroduce them
in the forms of various bets that the characters make to settle their
differences. That feels a bit clumsy to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that while the characters are the great strength of the story,
there are simply too many of them. Most of them are interesting and could have
their own story, but unfortunately, breadth comes at the expense of depth. It at
times feel like we get to meet a character, learn part of his backstory, see him
fight, and then he is forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the early &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; characters that felt like a big part of the story
haven&amp;#39;t been seen in more than 150 episodes at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pace is rather fast, and it&amp;#39;s fair to say that the webtoon is a page-turner
(or rather, a panel-scroller). It&amp;#39;s gotten me to neglect my sleep more so than
usual a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to make another criticism to the manhwa, is that it&amp;#39;s sometimes a
bit hard to follow. In particular, games tend to have quite intricate rules —
which I&amp;#39;m all for, but they aren&amp;#39;t explained very clearly. I often realize
partway that I misinterpreted the intent of the rules. You&amp;#39;d think that drawings
would help, but alas very often it doesn&amp;#39;t. The drawing are not especially
confusing (except sometimes during fights), but they don&amp;#39;t help that much. Also
— and funnily enough — since at some points there are so damn many characters
around, the author does not always draw all of them. That leads to some weird
situations where you suddenly realize &amp;quot;oh, that guy was there all along&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyhow, I find Tower of God amazing and grandiose, and I strongly recommend
you give it a look. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/tower-of-god/list?title_no=95&amp;amp;page=1&quot;&gt;Read it online here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;perry-mason&quot;&gt;Perry Mason&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Perry Mason show&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5O3cMmg3JQ&quot;&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; got me really hyped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character is reprised from the mythical &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Mason&quot;&gt;50&amp;#39;s TV Show&lt;/a&gt;, which
has already undergone quite a few reboots since then. In this case, it&amp;#39;s an
origin story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first episode, which I watched with my girlfriend, left us both thoroughly
nonplussed. And we left it at that. Live on the hype, die on the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hellsing-ultimate&quot;&gt;Hellsing Ultimate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had in the back of my mind that Hellsing was a classic, and I ought to see
some. There are two versions adapting the original manga: an anime, and a series
of 1-hour-long OVAs called Hellsing Ultimate. Similarly to Fullmetal Alchemist,
the first (anime) version diverged to the (at the time unfinished manga), while
Ultimate is faithful to the source material. The general sentiment on the
internet was that Ultimate was by far superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I ended up seeing only one of the episodes, which managed to bore me
thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a show about the aesthetics. Since I haven&amp;#39;t mentioned anything
of the show yet: it&amp;#39;s about vampires. And two secretive organizations fighting
the supernatural and one another. And gore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify, by &lt;em&gt;aesthestics&lt;/em&gt;, I mean the mood of the modern-yet-gothic setting, not the
art and animation which don&amp;#39;t strike me as particularly something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if vampires are your thing, go for it. But I think that even if you have to
throw the story to the wind, the new &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-6/#castlevania-all-3-seasons&quot;&gt;Castlevania&lt;/a&gt; anime is far superior,
mood-wise, if you like vampires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fire-force-s2&quot;&gt;Fire Force S2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done quite a reversal on this one from &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-5/#enen-no-shouboutai-fire-force&quot;&gt;my season 1 review&lt;/a&gt;.
I dropped it after 3 episodes. It&amp;#39;s not that it was bad per se, but rather my
time was getting rather limited, and I just found this to be the worst of the
anime I was watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few things that informed my decisions. First, these three episodes
were relatively filler heavy. But when they weren&amp;#39;t they just added more
seemingly disparate strands in the story. I would expect it to go into a bit
more depth in the characters and explore their relationships, or explore the
revelations from last seasons. Instead, new elements are piled on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having many balls in the air is not necessarily a bad thing — see Game of
Thrones (the books and the book-inspired seasons) for an example of how to do
that masterfully. But it is bad if it comes at the expense of depth. Here I have
the feeling that many of the introduced side-players are not ultimately relevant
to the storyline. This is not an intricate inter-woven story, but rather a
straightforward story that keeps stalling by adding side-cast and side-stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, this should still be fairly entertaining, but it just didn&amp;#39;t make
the cut this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kaguya-sama-love-is-war-season-2&quot;&gt;Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to add to &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-7/#kaguya-sama-love-is-war&quot;&gt;my review of season 1&lt;/a&gt;, this is still great. In fact,
I was surprised that they managed to keep the formula so fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get the feeling that the people writing this are quite clever. It&amp;#39;s not easy
to balance the line between running gag (a big component of the humor) and
unexpected, funny development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story-wise, the relationship manages to both progress and stay in the same
place, which is quite an achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m quite curious to see what they have in store for season 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-marie-kondo&quot;&gt;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up (Marie Kondo)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318578-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up&quot;&gt;super famous book&lt;/a&gt; on a tidying method that famously
preaches getting rid of anything that &amp;quot;does not spark joy&amp;quot;. It even spawned a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvyeapVBLWY&quot;&gt;Netflix series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pretty organized, and also pretty sympathetic with what I&amp;#39;d heard about it.
But the real reason I read it is because my girlfriend is a fan. I didn&amp;#39;t
actually &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; it. I listened to the Audiobook. It&amp;#39;s fairly short: about 4.5hrs
— less if you speed it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d actually read quite a few things about this a few years ago, most notably
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raptitude.com/2015/07/out-of-sight/&quot;&gt;this nice article&lt;/a&gt;, but I also perused some summaries you can
find on the net, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;. So actually listening to the
book didn&amp;#39;t really teach me anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which didn&amp;#39;t mean it was all that uninteresting. Marie Kondo is quite the
character. I&amp;#39;m a major nerd, but I was at time slightly creeped out by the depth
of her obsession with tidying. I also was surprised that she seemed quite
superstitions and ... pop-spiritual? I know she&amp;#39;s a Japanese woman, but that
seemed too easy of a stereotype. It&amp;#39;s not just for the sake of the original
audience either — the woman does talk to her clothes and to her house, after
all. Not my jam, but ultimately just a funny detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the book also tries — and achieves — is selling the cleaned-up lifestyle.
Kondo goes to great length to paint a nice picture of your life in a clean,
zen-like environment, where you can enjoy a hot cup of tea (or your beverage of
choice) surrounded only by those objects you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of advice in the book (it&amp;#39;s quite actionable), but what I
personally got out of it was a bit of motivation to sort out my stuff a bit
more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;flcl&quot;&gt;FLCL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t know much about FLCL (pronounced Fooly Cooly) going in, except that it
was well regarded, and that it had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAE8c7NcO7Q&amp;amp;list=PL5PW5TdgaMATZV3Z3_zhsj3V-Mu6e3owr&quot;&gt;great music&lt;/a&gt; by The Pillows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was ... not what I expected. It&amp;#39;s completely crazy, opaque, and quite
incomprehensible. Ok, to be fair, you kinda follow along, it&amp;#39;s just that the
plot is not intended to really make sense, as is clearly stated during a couple
of 4th-wall breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it&amp;#39;s entertaining, by virtue of being an unrelenting assault on the
senses. It feels like each episode is a fan edit of a whole 4-6 episodes arc
that actually makes sense into a single ultra-condensed episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me when writing this review is how old this anime actually is.
It&amp;#39;s from 2000 - 20 years old. Yet it looks so modern. I pulled the page for
Gainax (the studio) and they published &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/anime/276/Mahoromatic__Automatic_Maiden&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; the year before, and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/anime/276/Mahoromatic__Automatic_Maiden&quot;&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; the year after. FLCL must really have looked like an OVNI,
it&amp;#39;s no wonder it made such a splash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It not only looks modern, but also sounds modern. At least it&amp;#39;s as out there
today as it was back then — though we probably are more accustomed to &amp;quot;out
there&amp;quot; things today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I understand why it&amp;#39;s a classic. I&amp;#39;m pretty happy to have seen it. It&amp;#39;s very
short (6 regular-sized episodes), which helps to make it go down easy. I don&amp;#39;t
think I would say it was a good anime, but it was quite an experience which I&amp;#39;m
unlikely to forget. For some, that&amp;#39;s what it means to be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-good-place-seasons-2-3--4&quot;&gt;The Good Place Seasons 2, 3 &amp;amp; 4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-4/#the-good-place-season-1&quot;&gt;Season 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good place keeps entertaining! I wondered how they would keep things going
and entertaining after the big twist at the end of season 1, but they managed
brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without spoiling too much, season 2 features a lot of character development for
one particular character in a way that really adds to the dynamic of our little
group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Season 3 is quite different from the previous one, as it&amp;#39;s the first one taking
place mostly on earth. It&amp;#39;s also a bit more disjointed as the original &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot;
gets disrupted midway. All in all, a good job in keeping the charm without
exhausting the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did actually have again a pretty large gap (two months or so?) between season
2 and 3, and it was a pleasure to come back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Season 4 was pleasant too. I felt like the start was maybe a bit weaker, but the
enjoyment is still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show frequently engages with philosophical questions, but the end was, I
think, the most interesting stab at this in the series. In term of watching
experience, I love it. But as far as the philosophy is concerned, I hate it. Let
me discuss it being a spoiler tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;
&lt;summary&gt;Discussion with &lt;b&gt;spoilers&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the final arc of the good place grapples with the idea of immortality, and
eternal boredom. Basically, everyone in the real good place is bored out of
their minds. The solution the protagonists come up with is simple: let people die
for real (no afterlife), whenever they chose to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In principle, this is a good solution. I&#39;m generally pro-freedom, people
shouldn&#39;t be forced to live, especially forever (no quoting out of context: we
should make effort to keep depressive people alive here in the real world). But
also, nobody should be forced to die, and the solution leaves open the
possibility to live forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worry, however, that the philosophical message is all wrong. It says
something like &quot;life is worth living only because it ends&quot;. One of my
controversial opinion (though really, I don&#39;t think it should be) is that we
should strive to live forever, i.e. fight the disease known as aging. This &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html&quot;&gt;parable&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent
introduction if you&#39;re not familiar with the idea (there&#39;s also &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY&quot;&gt;a narrated/illustrated
version&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&#39;t think that I&#39;d ever get bored if I were to live forever. The
truth is that the world moves faster than we can apprehend. There are constantly
new &lt;emph&gt;interesting&lt;/emph&gt; things happening. I&#39;m interested in so many things
that I will never have time to investigate, but worse: the mass of interesting
things grows faster than my ability to investigate them. The idea that
everything is just repeating is popular, but it&#39;s jaded cynicism. I still enjoy
learning new things about topics I&#39;m an expert in. Your favorite game is never
boring if you haven&#39;t played it in a while. The idea that super long lifetimes
would be boring is just a sad failure of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really think &quot;death makes life worth living&quot; is more of a cope than
anything else, because in the current state of things we are all destined to
die, and it does make us feel better to believe currently unavoidable death is
somehow meaningful. Unfortunately, this has the side-effect of generating anger
towards people fighting the good fight against aging. It shouldn&#39;t be so - aging
is the number one cause of mortality. People typically talk a big game, but it
seems to me that nobody who&#39;s not greatly in pain (mentally or physically) ever
chooses to voluntarily end their own life. If given the choice, anybody who
isn&#39;t tremendously suffering will choose to live another day, every single
day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough about the philosophy. I said that despite this, the final arc was
great. It is, because — you guessed it — most of the characters eventually
decide to die, and the idea is executed gracefully, providing an emotional
payload that is only appropriate for the season finale. I don&#39;t think I can say
much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rezero-season-2-part-1&quot;&gt;Re:Zero Season 2 (Part 1)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;https://norswap.com/even-more-anime/#rezero&quot;&gt;Season 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had big expectations ... and it&amp;#39;s too early to tell if they will be met or
not. Season 3 certainly kicks off fast &amp;amp; hard, and difficulties and mysteries
keep piling on ... and on ... and on. What&amp;#39;s going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past what I would say is the &amp;quot;introduction&amp;quot; of the season, the arc becomes very
unusual because (1) the number of variables seemingly keep increasing all the
time, and (2) it doesn&amp;#39;t have a proper ending!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to split the season in two parts, with the break before the arc
could find a resolution, seems very questionable to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that the setup is bad — mostly it is excellent. It&amp;#39;s that the timing is
deplorable. The show builds up tension for 10 weeks, and then goes on hiatus for
months. Chance is we won&amp;#39;t remember all the balls that are in the air when part
2 comes around. And there are now more balls in the air than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also while the setup is excellent, it&amp;#39;s hard to offer commentary on the arc
without knowing its resolution. A crappy resolution could make the setup
worthless, while a good one will sublimate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t seen this yet, my advice would be to wait and watch it only
shortly before part 2 comes around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;deca-dence&quot;&gt;Deca-Dence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go into Deca-Dence blind, the second episodes yield a pretty unexpected
twist (read at your own risk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deca-Dence is an original story (not an adaptation). Earth is now a sort of
post-apocalyptic MMORPG entertainment park for androids living in a space
station. The last humans live in the mobile fortress Deca-Dence, which they
mostly maintain, while androids log into human-looking avatars to fight the
post-apocalyptic monsters that threathen the fortress (that&amp;#39;s the
&amp;quot;entertainement&amp;quot;). But the humans are not aware of all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, Deca-dence is okay. The story is good but not great, so are the
characters. It&amp;#39;s above average without really shining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a fan of the pseudo-chibi style used to depict the androids. I think it
might have been selected in part to reduce cost and speed up production, but it
adds nothing artistically speaking (and I just don&amp;#39;t like how it looks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lukewarm recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-god-of-high-school&quot;&gt;The God of High School&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;god-of-highschool.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This anime gets my award for worst-named anime of the year. No high school is
actually featured, and the protagonists neither look nor act like they&amp;#39;re high
school students (more like 20-somethings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is really the &lt;em&gt;anime&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s fault. This is actually an adaptation of a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/kennycomics-webtoon-101/whats-webtoonmangamanhwamanhua/viewer?title_no=5956&amp;amp;episode_no=8&quot;&gt;webtoon manhwa&lt;/a&gt; of the same name, made in collaboration with CrunchyRoll, just
like &lt;a href=&quot;#tower-of-god&quot;&gt;Tower of God&lt;/a&gt;. And this time too, it&amp;#39;s one of the most popular manhwa on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webtoons.com/en/&quot;&gt;webtoons.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get it out of the way: the story isn&amp;#39;t really brilliant. The titular &amp;quot;Gof
of Highschool&amp;quot; is actually a free-style everything-allowed mixed-martial-arts
tournament (powered by convenient nanobots that can heal almost any wounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early season is heavy on flashbacks that flesh out the personality of
the main characters and also various other secondary characters. It&amp;#39;s not
exactly subtle, but mostly it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partway, it is revealed that most of the stronger participants use &amp;quot;charyeok&amp;quot; to
draw on the power of some kinds of spirits/divinity — because eh, why the hell
not? It&amp;#39;s almost funny how everyone takes it in stride that some fighters have
basically magical powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, God of Highschool doesn&amp;#39;t really bother to avoid straining credibility.
Surprisingly, this ends up working to its advantage. While fights start
innocuous enough, they escalate to ridiculous over-the-top mystically-powered
world-threatening WTF-inducing affairs by the end of the season. And it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being more of a story guy, I didn&amp;#39;t expect to enjoy this so much, but enjoy it I
did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rent-a-girlfriend-kanojo-okarishimasu&quot;&gt;Rent-a-Girlfriend (Kanojo, Okarishimasu)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;quot;harem&amp;quot; anime was popular this summer, but I&amp;#39;m going to give it a &amp;quot;meh&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot is simple: main guy Kazuya uses a girlfriend-for-rental service to go
on a date with main girl Mizuhara. Accidentally they get introduced to each
other&amp;#39;s grandmothers and have to keep the pretense up to keep them happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem with the show is the cast. Mizuhara is probably the best of the
lot, in a harsh-but-secretely-kind way, though there&amp;#39;s nothing incredible about
the characterization. The other girls thouh... you have a psychopath, an
&lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; overly attached girl, and a girl that appears in  a single episode
(all four being prominently featured in the OP and ED). As for Kazuya... let&amp;#39;s
just say he makes Shinji &amp;quot;just get into the robot&amp;quot; from &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#neon-genesis-evangelion&quot;&gt;Evangelion&lt;/a&gt; look like a
paragon of bravery and poise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the character designs are pretty cool. But still meh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hunter-x-hunter-2011-14-episodes&quot;&gt;Hunter x Hunter 2011 (14 episodes)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the start of this show on a couple recommendations, but I&amp;#39;m conflicted
about it. It&amp;#39;s a sympathetic show, but it hasn&amp;#39;t given too much reason to care
so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me most about it is that the anime came out in 2011. It feels
more like a Pokemon-era anime, or even Dragon Ball-era. This can probably be
explained by the fact that it&amp;#39;s an adaptaiton of a 1998 manga, and also the
reboot of a 1999 anime series. I&amp;#39;m wondering if it would have been possible to
impart a slightly more &amp;quot;modern&amp;quot; flair to the series (not that the vintage style
detracts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main issue I have with the series so far is that it&amp;#39;s quite slow. It&amp;#39;s not
&lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; filler, but there are quite a few episodes that could be easily
compressed to half the time without losing much. It&amp;#39;s not so much about useless
plot as about timing — scenes just seem to linger a bit (or for some, a lot)
longer than they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been told the first arc is not the best, so I might give it another
shot, but I think I&amp;#39;ll give some other animes a chance in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kuragehime-princess-jellyfish&quot;&gt;Kuragehime (Princess Jellyfish)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;kuragehime.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of my girlfriend Sasha&amp;#39;s favorite anime. And what can I say, the
lady&amp;#39;s got good taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggle to explain why this is good. It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josei_manga&quot;&gt;josei&lt;/a&gt;, so admittedly not the
genre I&amp;#39;m the most familiar with. I think mostly it comes done to great loveable
dorky characters, and impeccable timing that never leaves you bored nor makes
you feel hurried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show is about a sisterhood of major lady nerds (each nerding on a very
specific topic). Things are shaken up a little bit when a stylish lady enters
their lives and the future of their shared housing is threatened. The story is a
solid driver, but isn&amp;#39;t going to have you gripping the edge of your seat. Again,
you&amp;#39;re going to be watching this for the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one short season (11 episodes), forming an incomplete adaptation of a
longer manga series. It stops at a logical place, but quite clearly the story is
far from over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tenet&quot;&gt;Tenet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed all of Nolan&amp;#39;s films that I&amp;#39;ve seen, and this one was no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many of Nolan&amp;#39;s film, it features a complicated time structure. This time
dealing with actual time travel — sort of. If you really liked the idea of
Inception, you might feel at home here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s tackle the elephant in the room: the movie will hurt your brain. The
time-travelling mechanism presented is not intuitive and has a lot of fun but
finicky implications. This is definitely the most complex time-travel movie I&amp;#39;ve
seen, maybe tying with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film)&quot;&gt;Primer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually enjoy these kind of movies. At least if I&amp;#39;m able to figure out most
of it, or if it&amp;#39;s explained at some point. I managed to follow the plot pretty
well, and fortunately, because what transpires in the most intricate scenes is
never laid out explicitly. The movie never stops to do a play-by-play of what
transpired, and the criticism I&amp;#39;ve heard is that it left some people stranded
during the viewing. Fortunately, the movie is still enjoyable as-is (you can
still follow), but if you want pure actions, there are better flicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all in all, a unique viewing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;skeleton-soldier-couldnt-defend-the-dungeon-up-to-chapter-109&quot;&gt;Skeleton Soldier Couldn&amp;#39;t Defend The Dungeon (up to chapter 109)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;skeleton-soldier.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeleton Soldier (for short) is a another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/kennycomics-webtoon-101/whats-webtoonmangamanhwamanhua/viewer?title_no=5956&amp;amp;episode_no=8&quot;&gt;webtoon manhwa&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;ve been devouring
one month or two ago, catching up to the current state of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s about... a skeleton soldier, that dies, but is reborn. Except this time,
he&amp;#39;s some sort of RPG protagonist in his own world. He can level and acquire
abilities. If he dies, he travels back in time to start again, but keeping his
level and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an interesting premise, and the webtoon does it justice by introducing
interesting characters that kriss-kross through the skeleton&amp;#39;s multiple
lifetimes, and setting up engaging mysteries about the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that skeleton can die is a big plus story-wise. Even though death is
merely a setback, the skeleton is invested in his &amp;quot;lifetime&amp;quot;, typically building
relationships with other characters who will forget all about him if he dies.
He&amp;#39;s also typically trying to achieve something. The hero actually being able to
die and be meaningfully set back does avoid the &amp;quot;plot armor&amp;quot; problem where the
hero always succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for having a skeleton as a main protagonist, that&amp;#39;s also an interesting
choice. It&amp;#39;s ultimately not a huge deal (this would have worked just as well
with a human), but it&amp;#39;s an interesting twist that the story does exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise and setting bears a lot of resemblance to &lt;a href=&quot;https://levelingsolo.com/&quot;&gt;Solo Leveling&lt;/a&gt;, a webtoon
I&amp;#39;m currently reading (review next time, probably). I&amp;#39;d say that from what I
have read so far (~ 70 chapters), Skeleton Soldier has the more interesting and
intricate story. Solo leveling being very enjoyable still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very recommended if you&amp;#39;re into RPG, isekai or action manga/manhwa at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rick--morty-season-1--2&quot;&gt;Rick &amp;amp; Morty (Season 1 &amp;amp; 2)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;#39;m giving the phenomenon a shot, watching it with Sasha (it&amp;#39;s a
rewatch for her).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s good. It&amp;#39;s weird. It&amp;#39;s definitely somewhat unique. I&amp;#39;m not sure it hypes me
up incredibly however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem might be the episodic nature. I like stories, and most episodes
don&amp;#39;t really move the story or the characters forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show is notoriously absurd or over-the-top sometimes, and while it&amp;#39;s not
something I generally enjoy, it works okay here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what I liked the most so far were the really dark moments, where
characters hit rock bottom (in a way that is not just implied to be funny and
temporary) and have to live with the consequence of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 6 of season 1 is the best example of that, and is my favorite Rick &amp;amp;
Morty moment by far. Season 2 also built something like that, but it&amp;#39;s up to
season 3 what to make of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The humor is okay by me, but if I were in for the laughs, I&amp;#39;d rather watch
Brooklyn 99 or The IT Crowd or How I Met Your Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder about the popularity of this. Is it for others like it is for me, that
the enjoyable but light nature of the show, punctuated by unexpected gut punches
that makes it memorable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-boys-season-1--2&quot;&gt;The Boys (Season 1 &amp;amp; 2)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;the-boys.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a show gave me a reason to check out that Prime video I have since
forever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this show, superheroes are real, and they&amp;#39;re a big business. In addition to
being a contractor police force, the whole Marvel-style
cinema/comics/merchandising complex is in full swing. All the big names are
being managed by a megacorp called Vought. Unfortunately, not all superheroes
are as nice as it seems, and many are assholes and downright psychopaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The destiny of the main protagonist is changed when his girlfriend is caught in
an &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot; involving a superhero, and a man called Butcher offers his help to
take down the responsible superhero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to be remarked about the show is how it situates itself in the
zeitgeist. It has Marvel-style hero mania, sexual harrassment scandals,
marketing-driven diversity, social justice, political polarization, christian
fundamentalists, using terrorism as an excuse to do nefarious shit, and even
meme-based opinion campaigns. And mostly, the show makes it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show is adopted from a comic book, but from what I&amp;#39;ve read, it takes a lot
of liberty with the original material — I think its situation within the
zeitgeist is an example of that. The original comic started publishing in 2006,
two full years before the first Iron Man movie (arguably the first modern MCU
movie).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first season was my favourite of the two. The story is more straightforward.
The second season ... I have mixed feelings about. Well, it was very good, and
very enjoyable to watch. Some small elements felt off, however. In particular,
it felt that sometimes &amp;quot;world-level&amp;quot; happenings are being pushed to drive the
plot forward in a way that is unsubtle, and not particulary credible — typically
involving fickle public opinion. Some choices were questionable to me. Did the
plot really need to involve &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; nazis (not neo-nazis, but 1940s nazis)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the second season also pulls no punches. The third episode could
basically have been a season finale, and it gets crazier after that. I thought
the ending was a bit of a cope (an easy way out, if you will), but eh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoutout to Karl Urban, whose Butcher is fantastic. And shoutout to the writers
for making Hughie not too annoying. After watching the first episode, I expected
him to be a painful drag of a protagonist, but the writers dosed his reticence
just right, so this didn&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? Anti-heroes, obviously, in a very literal sense. Morally gray, as
they are not always entirely morally upstanding. Butcher, in particular, has to
deal with his demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well worth watching, feels very fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dorohedoro&quot;&gt;Dorohedoro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;dorohedoro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorohedoro takes place in some sort of slum called &amp;quot;the hole&amp;quot; that is connected
to a magical realm. Sorcerers regularly come out to &amp;quot;practice&amp;quot; (which mostly
involves transforming, killing and mangling innocent holes denizen). The
protagonist Caiman lost all his memories and his head was changed to that of a
reptilian, presumably due to such an encounter. Together with his cook friend
Nikaido, he tries to reclaim his memory and original form. Doing so, he&amp;#39;ll face
against a gang of magicians including a dude that turns everything into
mushroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorohedoro is kinda crazy, but in a good way. I liked the humor and the action,
and for a universe that is so non-sensical, the world-building is suprisingly
solid. The story is solid, with clues to the main mystery being given
throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also greatly appreciated that the anime dumps you in its universe, giving you
information as necessary instead of doing tedious information dumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My only regret is that after the 13 episodes first season, it feels like we have
barely scratched the main story, and a second season hasn&amp;#39;t been confirmed (yet?).&lt;/p&gt;

important lesson for your arguments and debates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the key takeaway, and a taste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a series of disputes on categories, which are really disputes on the
definition of the category. (Is a whale a fish? Is gender dysphoria a mental
illness?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, multiple definitions often makes sense. The key being to pick the
right one for the task at hand. An alternative categorization system is not an
error. You draw category boundaries in specific ways to capture tradeoffs you
care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (controversial) hair dryer incident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one obsessive compulsive woman would drive to work every morning and
worry she had left the hair dryer on and it was going to burn down her house.
So she’d drive back home to check that the hair dryer was off, then drive back
to work, then worry that maybe she hadn’t really checked well enough, then
drive back, and so on ten or twenty times a day [...] to the point where her
career was in a downspin and she thought she would have to quit and go on
disability. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’d seen countless psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors, she’d
done all sorts of therapy, she’d taken every medication in the book, and none of
them had helped. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she came to my hospital and was seen by a colleague of mine, who told her
“Hey, have you thought about just bringing the hair dryer with you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musashi is quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut
the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch
the enemy’s cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is
essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or
touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the primary thing in psychiatry is to help the patient, whatever the
means. Someone can concern-troll that the hair dryer technique leaves
something to be desired in that it might have prevented the patient from
seeking a more thorough cure that would prevent her from having to bring the
hair dryer with her. But compared to the alternative of “nothing else works”
it seems clearly superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a high status and uncontroversial belief to say that writing makes you
better at substantially everything white collar people do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is more controversial to believe being able to code makes you more effective
at everything white collar people do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Exploit until the market corrects” is one of my preferred ways to deal with

&lt;p&gt;men want sex but don&amp;#39;t know how to be sexy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the internet has made it so easy to know what women find sexy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which suggests to me that many (most?) dudes are either too stupid or lazy (or
scared?) to do what it takes to get what they want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and also, probably, that many (most?) don&amp;#39;t really want what they say they want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;things I’ve known women to find disarmingly sexy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;a man cooking, doing DIY, working on his car/guitar, working with his hands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;being skilled+charming with a child or elder person in a strong, masculine way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;smiling and laughing when she expected him to get upset/angry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that are unsexy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nitpicking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“debating”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;condescension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contempt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“you can have this precious penis if you pass these following tests and jump through the following hoops”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neediness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solipsism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insecurity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lack of imagination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inability to read subtext&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time diaries revealed that both groups (elite and average players) spent, on
average, the same number of hours on music per week (around 50).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elite players were spending almost three times more hours than the average
players on deliberate practice — the uncomfortable, methodical work of
stretching your ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average players, they discovered, spread their work throughout the day. The
elite players, by contrast, consolidated their work into two well-defined
periods (two peaks: in the morning and in the afternoon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elite players slept an hour more per night than the average players. The
elite players were significantly more relaxed than the average players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard work (delibrate practice) vs hard to do work (draining, busy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution suggested by this research, as well as my own, is as simple as it
is startling: Do less. But do what you do with complete and hard focus. Then
when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance coach, with a bent towards sports, surgery, and executive
performance, gives his thoughts on being a top performer. The key is the
&amp;quot;Trusting Mindset&amp;quot;: like a squirrel runs across a telephone wire. Just doing it,
without thought, because you&amp;#39;ve trained yourself plenty until that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best in every business do what they have learned to do without questioning
their abilities — they flat out trust their skills, which is why we call this
high-performance state of mind the “Trusting Mindset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot pull up all those years of education, training, and experience in
your memory as you perform — that’s the “Training” Mindset. In the Trusting
Mindset, you have to let all that expertise be there instinctively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different, in fact, as you and a squirrel running across a telephone wire!
Squirrels cannot think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put a two-by-four board on the floor and walk from one end to the other. It is
not hard. Not one of my students has ever fallen off the board. If you videotape
yourself doing this exercise, you will see that your foot hits the middle of the
board every step of the way, as if you were walking down the street. Your eyes
just look past the board at the far end, to where you’re going, and your feet
just move. Now suspend that board thirty feet in the air and walk from one end
to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually have recommended to some clients to create even more chaos at work
so that getting any work done at all will force them to be in the present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplify and narrow what you think about: Just go out target shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Periodization: Balance the right amount of stress with the right amount of
rest. Stress + rest = growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t multitask. Ever. Compartmentalize your day down to the hour. Each
compartment has a concrete objective. Be fully intentional with how you spend
your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking tends to be more effective at fostering creativity than other
movements that require greater focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in nature, or even just looking at pictures of nature, helps with the
transition from stress to rest and promotes creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group A studied the paper for four sessions.
Group B studied only once but was tested three times.
A week later both groups were tested, and Group B scored 50 percent higher than Group A.
They&amp;#39;d studied one-fourth as much yet learned far more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more we fire a particular circuit, the more myelin optimizes that circuit,
and the stronger, faster, and more fluent our movements and thoughts become. The
best way to build a good circuit is to fire it, attend to mistakes, then fire it
again, over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the human cardiovascular system actually works: that we can improve it by
targeting our aerobic or anaerobic systems, that we can strengthen our heart
and muscles by pushing ourselves to operate at the outer edges of our
ability - lifting a slightly heavier weight, or trying to run a slightly
farther distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purposeful practice requires getting out of one’s comfort zone. This is perhaps
the most important part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability and
determination. But there&amp;#39;s a third ingredient that&amp;#39;s not as well understood:
an obsessive interest in a particular topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at the lives of people who&amp;#39;ve done great work, you see a
consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket collector&amp;#39;s obsessive
interest in something that would have seemed pointless to most of their
contemporaries. One of the most striking features of Darwin&amp;#39;s book about his
voyage on the Beagle is the sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His
curiosity seems infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out
on his slate what happens to series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket collector. Series
matter, and bus tickets don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a mistake to think they were &amp;quot;laying the groundwork&amp;quot; for the discoveries
they made later. There&amp;#39;s too much intention in that metaphor. Like bus ticket
collectors, they were doing it because they liked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might be it: to
have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aren&amp;#39;t I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you might
think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for ability and a
substitute for determination. Unless you have sufficient mathematical
aptitude, you won&amp;#39;t find series interesting. And when you&amp;#39;re obsessively
interested in something, you don&amp;#39;t need as much determination: you don&amp;#39;t need
to push yourself as hard when curiosity is pulling you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an obsession might
be one that matters. For example, it&amp;#39;s more promising if you&amp;#39;re creating
something, rather than just consuming something someone else creates. It&amp;#39;s
more promising if something you&amp;#39;re interested in is difficult, especially if
it&amp;#39;s more difficult for other people than it is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can never be sure. In fact, here&amp;#39;s an interesting idea that&amp;#39;s also
rather alarming if it&amp;#39;s true: it may be that to do great work, you also have
to waste a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice would be: rigorously eliminate everything from your life which doesn&amp;#39;t
fit inside your top X critical priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where X is as small as possible, and seek to cull it further by combining
equivalents and trying to identify why some &amp;#39;important&amp;#39; things might actually be
utter wastes of time in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world generally uses a ratchet approach to conquer your attention. Use a
ratchet to take it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I do now is say something to the effect of: &amp;quot;after this, I&amp;#39;m limiting
myself to two more replies in this thread.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has various advantages. It feels less rude. It doesn&amp;#39;t look like I&amp;#39;m
quitting because I have no reply. It helps the conversation reach a more natural
conclusion. And it also feels a lot easier to do, partly for the above reasons
and partly for the normal reasons precommitment helps me to do things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But f could have multiple fixed points. Which one is right? You get to pick;
whichever fixed point you decide to believe ends up being correct, since they
are fixed points of the function determining the true probabilities from your
beliefs. Cases in which there are multiple such fixed points are cases in
which you actually can make something be true by believing it. So you may as
well believe the fixed point according to which you have the highest expected
utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tynan.com/thekey&quot;&gt;Consistency is The Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most productive people I know are people who absolutely master the basics.
They know how to fill the time in the day with the most important tasks they
have, and they know how to string those days together in such a way that
they&amp;#39;re making meaningful progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important basic skill to master, without a doubt, is consistency.
Those who are able to be consistent end up with huge success, very often much
greater success than they expected or even hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in finance say that people aren&amp;#39;t able to comprehend the benefits of
compounding interest over time. Consistency in productivity creates compound
benefits which people are similarly not able to comprehend. Your starting
point doesn&amp;#39;t matter, because you can quickly scale up to your capacity once
you have a history and habit of consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you wanted to write a book. Maybe you&amp;#39;d tried and failed before. If
you commit to writing for thirty minutes every day for a month, you&amp;#39;ll write
at least 10 to 15 thousand words. Not bad. Then the next month you up your
quota to just one hour. Now you have a cumulative 30 to 45 thousand words. Not
quite a book yet, but you&amp;#39;re a month away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how easy does that process sound? Anyone can do half an hour a day. Anyone
who has done a half hour a day for a month can do an hour a day. And anyone
who has done an hour a day can do another month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to matter what you choose to be consistent on
or how easy or difficult it is. I&amp;#39;ve experimented a lot with this, and even
the easiest tasks lead to a positive spiral of consistency. I&amp;#39;ve found that as
soon as I get a coaching client to be consistent with any tasks relevant to
their lives, they will generally remain consistent forever, with a few
variances here and there&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not convinced that the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment tests for anything
even remotely resembling “innate willpower,” because waiting fifteen minutes
for a single marshmallow is a stupid thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a type of joke that I think of as the “white people” joke, although
it’s rarely funny and it doesn’t have to be about someone who’s white. The
joke is about a mid-40’s housewife who is way too well-educated and bored to
be a housewife, and so she tries to find the Grail of healthy food (organic,
GMO-free, low acidity, one diet after another) and she plants a garden, and
she adopts pets, and she joins nonprofits, and she joins the school board, and
she reads every novel on NPR’s end of the year list, and she gets weekly
therapy and monthly massages (to about the same effect), and she meditates on
the present, and she achieves peace with the past, and she contemplates the
future, and everything is feng shui, and yet, despite all this, she feels
restless, anxious, unhappy, and she dreams of some sort of vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or sometimes the joke is about an elderly businessman on his second hair
transplant and third cardiac stent and twenty-billionth dollar, and his kids
all have grandkids and his wife is deceased, and when he goes out he he orders
scotch more expensive than houses, but that isn’t too often—he’s seen enough
parties, he’s seen enough people, he has no strong affections, and he works
round the clock fighting tooth-and-nail for his billions, because he’s not
sure what else, exactly, he’s supposed to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the joke is about a magazine-cover movie actress who has the adoration of
thousands and still feels worthless. Or the joke is about a virginal computer
science genius who has deleted his OKCupid and decided to eschew all noncoding
activities. Or the joke is about a millionaire athlete under investigation for
using anabolic steroids. Or the joke is about a 50-something cardiologist who
hates all his patients but knows that he’d hate being retired even more. Or
the joke is about a young power couple who like each other very much, love,
maybe, but they’re both distracted by the nagging feeling that they could do
better, that they should be shooting for something greater, and so they break
up and find new partners and the process repeats again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the joke, which you hear on forums or sitcoms or in crowded sports bars,
goes: “Haha, even though these people are successful, they’re still
dissatisfied.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m here to tell you that this joke is totally backwards. It’s because
these people have always been dissatisfied that they achieved success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study implies that socially prescribed perfectionism is maladaptive and
self oriented perfectionism is adaptive, but it has the causality backwards. If
you ace a difficult O-chem test, do you want to believe that this was the result
of your übermensch willpower or “big surprise, my parents have been pushing me
for years”? Inversely, if you just failed an O-chem test, it’s much preferable
to think “My family thinks I’m a failure. They’re so unfair,” instead of “I’m a
loser.&amp;quot; This is Psych 101:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being intrinsically motivated doesn’t make you successful. Feeling successful
makes you intrinsically motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Georgism is a good idea that Homo sapiens is not an enlightened enough
species to put into practice&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The financial/investment world has no clue what&amp;#39;s going on, is afraid of
everything, and has been largely reduced to One Weird Trick: financialization.
The One Weird Trick is increasingly being executed by minds that have already
retreated to New Zealand bunkers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;90&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most bad politics arises out of bad literary tastes, as in enjoying stories
about stereotypes. Good politics arises out of pattern matching archetypes while
they still have &amp;quot;alpha&amp;quot; (predictive power) with a tasteful literary sensibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;91&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stereotypes are real, and there is always a subset of every stereotyped
population that actually willingly conforms to that stereotype, performing it
with an aggressive deadness. These dead player zombies are the core of all
politics. All politics is about seeing dead people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;93&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zizek is correct. The Normie ideology is cynicism, and conversely, all
ideology turns into cynicism by the time it goes normie. This is why Noble Lie
political philosophy is bs because there is no unawakened consciousness laboring
under from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You have no obligation to be useful or interesting to the world.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No person would ever create anything unless they&amp;#39;re bored, scared or horny out
of their mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t dampen it in people, don&amp;#39;t make it all &lt;em&gt;mindful&lt;/em&gt;; you will lose that

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DoPo4PDjgSySquHX8/heads-i-win-tails-never-heard-of-her-or-selective-reporting&quot;&gt;Heads I Win, Tails?—Never Heard of Her; Or, Selective Reporting and the Tragedy
of the Green Rationalists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reliability of the Bayesian belief-updating process depends entirely on how
facts are being reported. If someone distorts the reporting, it won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within your faction you are disincentivized to report things that are coded to
the other faction. So Bayesian updating becomes broken unless you take this
distortion into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/&quot;&gt;The Mind of Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than even Ronald Reagan, Trump seems supremely cognizant of the fact that
he is always acting. He moves through life like a man who knows he is always
being observed. If all human beings are, by their very nature, social actors,
then Donald Trump seems to be more so—superhuman, in this one primal sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Trump, the concept of “the deal” represents what psychologists call a
personal schema — a way of knowing the world that permeates his thoughts.
Cognitive-science research suggests that people rely on personal schemata to
process new social information efficiently and effectively. By their very
nature, however, schemata narrow a person’s focus to a few well-worn approaches
that may have worked in the past, but may not necessarily bend to accommodate
changing circumstances. A key to successful decision making is knowing what your
schemata are, so that you can change them when you need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all of us, presidents create in their minds personal life stories—or what
psychologists call narrative identities—to explain how they came to be who they
are. This process is often unconscious, involving the selective reinterpretation
of the past and imagination of the future. A growing body of research in
personality, developmental, and social psychology demonstrates that a life story
provides adults with a sense of coherence, purpose, and continuity over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has never forgotten the lesson he learned from his father and from his
teachers at the academy: The world is a dangerous place. You have to be ready to
fight. The same lesson was reinforced in the greatest tragedy that Trump has
heretofore known—the death of his older brother at age 43. Freddy Trump was
never able to thrive in the competitive environment that his father created.
Described by Blair in The Trumps as “too much the sweet lightweight, a mawkish
but lovable loser,” Freddy failed to impress his father in the family business
and eventually became an airline pilot. Alcoholism contributed to his early
death. Donald, who doesn’t drink, loved his brother and grieved when he died.
“Freddy just wasn’t a killer,” he concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theoryengine.org/mental-health/book-review-impro-by-keith-johnstone/&quot;&gt;Book Review: Impro by Keith Johnstone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play-acting to avoid failure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will arrive with many techniques for avoiding the pain of failure. John
Holt’s ‘How Children Fail’ (Penguin, 1969, Pitman, 1970) gives examples of
children learning to get round problems, rather than learning to find solutions
to problems. If you screw your face up and bite on your pencil to show you’re
‘trying’, the teacher may write out the answer for you... I explain to the
students the devices they’re using to avoid tackling the problems – however easy
the problems are – and the release of tension is often amazing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This realisation that as adults we are avoiding problems by play-acting “please
be nice to me” signals, signals we learned as children to please overworked
teachers, that are a pointless distraction from actually doing something seems
an excellent insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnstone came up with the idea of Status when finding a problem with his
actors in the studio – ordinary conversations on the stage seemed to be
incredibly dull and lifeless. At one point while watching another play, he was
inspired to think of strong or weak motivations for characters to do things,
and eventually asked his actors to try to seem very slightly higher or lower
in status than their partner. This method transformed the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people understand status very intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just tricks to get students to experience status changes. If I speak
with a still head, then I’ll do many other high-status things quite
automatically. I’ll speak in complete sentences, I’ll hold eye contact. I’ll
move more smoothly, and occupy more ’space’. If I talk with my toes pointing
inwards I’m more likely to give a hesitant little ‘er’ before each sentence,
and I’ll smile with my teeth covering my bottom lip, and I’ll sound a little
breathless and so on. We were amazed to find that apparently unrelated things
could so strongly influence each other; it didn’t seem reasonable that the
position of the feet could influence sentence structure and eye contact, but
it is so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes it&amp;#39;s not so intuitive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I introduced status work at the Studio, we found that people play
one status while convinced that they are playing the opposite. This obviously
makes for very bad social meshing… and many of us had to revise out whole idea
of ourselves. In my own case I was astounded to find that when I thought I was
being friendly, I was actually being hostile! If some had said ‘I like your
play’, I would have said ‘Oh, it’s not up to much’, perceiving myself as
‘charmingly modest’. In reality I would have been implying that my admirer had
bad taste. I experience the opposite situation when people come up, looking
friendly and supportive and say, ‘We did enjoy the end of Act One’, leaving me
to wonder what was wrong with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the best ideas are often psychotic, obscene and unoriginal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1149362892157775874?s=09&quot;&gt;Visakanv on Friendship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly the most important thing in a friendship - including one with
yourself, or your spouse, or your child - is attention. Deep, focused,
undivided, non-judgemental attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really see + hear the other person, in a world where people constantly feel
unseen &amp;amp; unheard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.takimag.com/article/the-great-awokening-conspiracy-theory/&quot;&gt;The Great Awokening Conspiracy
Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy theory is that the emergence of a socialist protest movement
three years after the economic collapse of 2008 terrified the rich. But they
noticed that Occupy was easily distracted from its class warfare by its urge
to indulge the perpetually wounded feelings of the “progressive stack.” The
more intersectional Pokémon Points that would-be speakers possess, the more
likely they are chosen to orate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich white guys, who aren’t dumb, would have quickly figured out that their
biggest worry is not-rich white guys. In contrast, privileging more
intersectional personalities, such as black women, tended to get leftists
sidetracked from discussing confiscatory taxes into passionate diatribes about
how white Beckys were dissing their Afros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory that Woke Capital cynically conspired to divide and conquer
economic leftism by promoting the Great Awokening sounds plausible enough.
Certainly, Bernie Sanders feels that now-fashionable notions like reparations
and open borders are millstones around the necks of any Democrats’ seriously
hoping to stick it to the billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underrated: The ability to steal the essence of what makes something else work
well, without also copying the superficial idiosyncratic details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/10/30/new-atheism-the-godlessness-that-failed/&quot;&gt;New Atheism: The Godlessness That
Failed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Atheism was a failed hamartiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hamartiology” is a subfield of theology dealing with the study of sin, in
particular, how sin enters the universe. Orthodox Christian hamartiology says we
all have original sin because Adam and Eve ate the apple. Gnostic hamartiologies
say we sin because we are ignorant of our true nature as celestial beings. Some
heretical hamartiologies say that all of this is irrelevant, and we sin because
we choose to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most movement atheists weren’t in it for the religion. They were in it for the
hamartiology. Once they got the message that the culture-at-large had settled on
a different, better hamartiology, there was no psychological impediment to
switching over. We woke up one morning and the atheist bloggers had all quietly
became social justice bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it took its first baby steps, the Blue Tribe started asking itself “Who am I?
What defines me?”, trying to figure out how it conceived of itself. New Atheism
had an answer – “You are the people who aren’t blinded by fundamentalism” – and
for a while the tribe toyed with accepting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Bush administration, with all its struggles over Radical Islam and
Intelligent Design and Faith-Based Charity, this seemed like it might be a
reasonable answer. The atheist movement and the network of
journalists/academics/pundits/operatives who made up the tribe’s core started
drifting closer together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually the Blue Tribe got a little bit more self-awareness and realized this
was not a great idea. Their coalition contained too many Catholic Latinos, too
many Muslim Arabs, too many Baptist African-Americans. Remember that in 2008,
“what if all the Hispanic people end up going Republican?” was considered a
major and plausible concern. It became somewhat less amenable to New Atheism’s
answer to its identity question – but absent a better one, the New Atheists
continued to wield some social power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betweem 2008 and 2016, two things happened. First, Barack Obama replaced George
W. Bush as president. Second, Ferguson. The Blue Tribe kept posing its same
identity question: “Who am I? What defines me?”, and now Black Lives Matter gave
them an answer they liked better “You are the people who aren’t blinded by
sexism and racism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it was beautiful, simple, and perfect. We were “the reality-based
community”. They were ignoring Reason and basing all of their opinions on blind
hatred and prejudice. There was nothing confusing or unsettling at all about the
situation, and we did not need to question any of our own beliefs. It was just
that some people had been brainwashed by white supremacy and an all-consuming
desire to protect their own privilege, and so they did. Sin began with the apple
tree in Eden; conservativism began with the cotton plant in Jamestown. Language
separates us from the apes; not being blinded by bigotry separates us from the
Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21376838&quot;&gt;Comment on &amp;quot;Thriving on the Technical Leadership Path&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience has been that the value of very senior technical staff is not that
they solve &amp;quot;extremely high level&amp;quot; technical problems but they are very easily
able to see how what appears to be a complex problem is isomorphic to a much
simpler, easy to solve problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between expert and advanced/intermediate technical staff is that
the advanced engineer has an understanding of complex solution and mistakenly
tries to apply them everywhere, so the net effect is to increase complexity. The
expert typically sees simple solutions and method of resolving complexity and
has a net effect of reducing overall system complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing that the value add of experienced technical staff is to only solve
really hard problem is likely caused by having too many advanced/intermediate
people playing the role of experienced technical leads. All of the great
technical team member I worked with always make call solutions simpler and
easier to implement by knowing exactly what doesn&amp;#39;t need to be done and what is
essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Reviews 7</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/more-anime/&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/even-more-anime/&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-4&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-5&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-6&quot;&gt;Six&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I&amp;#39;m also reviewing books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;darwins-game&quot;&gt;Darwin&amp;#39;s Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot to review this one &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-6&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it follows the &amp;quot;death game&amp;quot; formula: the protagonist gets sucked in a
game (via a smartphone app in this case) that gives him powers and in which
currency can be acquired by defeating (lethaly or not) other players. Of course
there&amp;#39;s a bunch of psychopaths, but also potential allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really enjoyed it, it was pretty fun. The show is thoughtful about powers and
how to use them. Nothing incredibly, but it&amp;#39;s only an 11-episode show and it&amp;#39;s
well worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;erased-boku-dake-ga-inai-machi&quot;&gt;Erased (Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked this one. The basic plot is that the hero is sent back to his
elementary school past, where he endeavours to prevent the murder of three kids
in his home town. These events are also connected to his present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is really solid and there is some real mystery. The tone reminded of
&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-4/#parasyte&quot;&gt;Parasyte&lt;/a&gt; a lot: it feels &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; - it&amp;#39;s darker than most anime, but never
edgy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Parasyte, this had the advantage to be an adaption of a finished series,
and a short one at that — the anime is only 12 episodes long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really solid recommendation from me, there is no reason not to watch this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;unsong&quot;&gt;Unsong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, a book review! Unsong is a book you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://unsongbook.com/&quot;&gt;read for free online&lt;/a&gt;,
written by the brilliant Scott Alexander (of &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/&quot;&gt;Slate Star Codex&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s fame — one of
my favorite blogs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the (wild!) plot: in 1972, instead of sending men on the moon, the Apollo
rocket crashed into the vast crystal sphere encircling the world. It turns out
it was part of the vast machinery of heaven built by archangel Uriel to slow the
divine light to a trickle, and ensure science works properly. With it cracked,
divine light enters the world once more and as some technology stop working, the
supernatural becomes possible once more. In particular, it is possible to speak
some of the names of god in order to produce spell-like effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsong is imaginative and brilliant. There are many other things introduced in
the universe besides the names of god, and their consequences are taken
seriously (though always somewhat humorously as well). For instance, there is a
whole branch of government (the titular &lt;em&gt;Unsong&lt;/em&gt;) dedicated to enforcing
copyrights on the names of god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsong is brilliant, but it is also weird. Its lore centers around the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabbalah&quot;&gt;Kabbalah&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;#39;s full of kabalistic jokes. Things like &amp;quot;this word means X
and Y and Z and so we get meanings A, B and C&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s clever and cute, but it
works better the first three times than the 50th time. Towards the end, I got a
bit tired of it, especially since it breaks the rythm of the descent towards the
conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsong is really two intertwined stories of different magnitudes. On the one
hand it is the story happening in the story&amp;#39;s present in the 2010s, and on the
other hand it is the story of how the world evolved since 1972, under the
influence of the radical new conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really hard to describe Unsong as a story I realize. I think the best thing
would be to give it a shot. If you generally like fiction that is a little weird
(e.g. Terry Pratchett, Snow Crash, ...) then I&amp;#39;d definitely recommend it. Ditto
if you tend to enjoy Scott&amp;#39;s normal writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rise-and-fall-of-software-recipes&quot;&gt;The Rise and Fall of Software Recipes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;banana-book.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aka &lt;em&gt;the banana book&lt;/em&gt;, after the lovely fruit peel that adorns the cover.
It&amp;#39;s written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dariusblasband.com/&quot;&gt;Darius Blasband&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raincode.com/&quot;&gt;Raincode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, from reading the book&amp;#39;s back cover, you&amp;#39;d be forgiven to think the book had
some grand thesis about &amp;quot;software recipes&amp;quot; and methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the book never really bothers to define what a software recipe is
(it does convey that it is a cookie cutter pattern to make software). Instead,
it should be taken as Darius&amp;#39;s working, tech &amp;amp; business, memoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, I think the book works relatively well. Darius describes himself
as a &amp;quot;codeaholic&amp;quot;, and he is definitely a compiler geek — which also happens to
be my case. As such many chapters of the book where of particular interest to
me. That being said, they remain accessible enough that any semi-competent
programmer should be able to understand the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes disagreed with Darius, and often wanted to add more nuance, but his
opinions never struck me as wrong-headed. There&amp;#39;s a lot of references to
projects and experiences on the ground that help to lend weight to some of his
points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writing is snappy and fun enough to keep you engaged. Chapters are typically
not too long, and the books lends itself well to sporadic reading. It would
actually have made a great toilet book. That being said, don&amp;#39;t expect your mind
to be blown away either. This is a no-nonsense collection software advice,
stories and ideas. While there are definitely some nuggets of insight to glean
there, I don&amp;#39;t think this will cause anyone that wasn&amp;#39;t already on board to
reconsider their whole processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kaguya-sama-love-is-war&quot;&gt;Kaguya-sama: Love is War&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was strongly recommended to me by my friend Gorby. And I have to admit:
it&amp;#39;s damn funny. The humor reminded me of &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-4/#dumbbell-nan-kilo-moteru-how-heavy-are-the-dumbells-you-lift&quot;&gt;Dumbbell nan Kilo&lt;/a&gt;, in a good way.
Despite the silly tone, the last episode managed to have my heart in a vise.
That&amp;#39;s how you know it&amp;#39;s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;m a sucket for that opening theme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3-gatsu no Lion has an excellent MyAnimeList score (8.45) and has is often
described as being great &amp;amp; artful. And I was curious to know what the fuss was
about. Well, I ended up dropping it (for the nonce at least) after 10 episodes
(out of 22 for the first season).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not bad by any stretch of the imagination. It&amp;#39;s just... very contemplative?
Slow? I think what I&amp;#39;ve seen so far could have been conveyed in half the time,
there are very repetitive scenes. At the same time, it might have been
deliberate. The anime certainly feels deliberate, and not like it&amp;#39;s trying to
please anyone, nor give itself a genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is related to the subject matter, which is ... complex. It&amp;#39;s
about the state of mind of this young pro shogi player. I&amp;#39;ll paste the MAL
description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having reached professional status in middle school, Rei Kiriyama is one of
the few elite in the world of shogi. Due to this, he faces an enormous amount
of pressure, both from the shogi community and his adoptive family. Seeking
independence from his tense home life, he moves into an apartment in Tokyo. As
a 17-year-old living on his own, Rei tends to take poor care of himself, and
his reclusive personality ostracizes him from his peers in school and at the
shogi hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not long after his arrival in Tokyo, Rei meets Akari, Hinata, and
Momo Kawamoto, a trio of sisters living with their grandfather who owns a
traditional wagashi shop. Akari, the oldest of the three girls, is determined
to combat Rei&amp;#39;s loneliness and poorly sustained lifestyle with motherly
hospitality. The Kawamoto sisters, coping with past tragedies, also share with
Rei a unique familial bond that he has lacked for most of his life. As he
struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally through his shogi
career, Rei must learn how to interact with others and understand his own
complex emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I dropped it because I found myself dragging my feet a little to
watch it, which is not a good sign. I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; give another chance at some point,
as I think there might be something great which I haven&amp;#39;t gotten to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mob-psycho-100-season-1&quot;&gt;Mob Psycho 100 (Season 1)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;mob-psycho-100.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost dropped Mob Psycho 100 after the first episode, which repeated its
&amp;quot;funny&amp;quot; shtick a bit too much, and I was unsure about the graphical style. I&amp;#39;m
glad I didn&amp;#39;t, as it turns out it&amp;#39;s quite entertaining, and you get used to the
goofiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t call it groundbreaking or anything, but it&amp;#39;s short (12 episodes) and
watchable. I don&amp;#39;t really have much more to say about it. It seems to be a very
beloved show (8.5 rating on MAL), and I can understand, the anime is not
incredible, but it is emminently sympathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hamefura&quot;&gt;Hamefura&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;hamefura.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Whole title &amp;quot;Otome Game no Hametsu Flag ...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;My Next Life as a Villainess:
All Routes Lead to Doom!&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This anime was not at all what I expected it to be. The premise is that the
titular character gets reincarnated in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel&quot;&gt;visual novel&lt;/a&gt; romance game, as the
villainess character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this premise I expected a &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-4/#the-rising-of-the-shield-hero&quot;&gt;Shield Hero&lt;/a&gt;-like situation: the main character
being treated unfairly and having (in this case) to battle its way to
recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, spoilers: that&amp;#39;s not at all what happens. Instead this is a very wholesome
sorta-kinda-harem anime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I really really loved it. I don&amp;#39;t really know why - the story is nothing to
write home about. I&amp;#39;m guessing it&amp;#39;s the &lt;em&gt;wholesomeness&lt;/em&gt; of the whole affair that
just put me in a good mood. It reminded me a bit of what I liked about &lt;a href=&quot;/more-anime/#k-on&quot;&gt;K-On!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;gleipnir&quot;&gt;Gleipnir&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plot-wise, Gleipnir is a sort of death game where protagonists have special
abilities. In that, it&amp;#39;s quite similar to last season&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;#darwin-s-game&quot;&gt;Darwin&amp;#39;s Game&lt;/a&gt;, but the
similarity stops there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas Darwin&amp;#39;s game is very focused on the strategies and combat, Gleipnir is
more about the mystery of the game&amp;#39;s existence. Well, at least it tries to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start is intriguing enough, but then the anime tramples around in its
midsection, not achieving much. The mystery plotline picks up towards the end,
just enough to keep things interesting. It&amp;#39;s not all that masterfully executed
however. They also could easily have concluded the 13 episode arc with some something
more impactful happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was ready to give up around episode 8, then got interested enough to finish,
but I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;ll care enough for season 2 (if they make it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;yesterday-wo-uttate&quot;&gt;Yesterday wo Uttate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started watching this show on the basis of its wistful mood. I&amp;#39;d seen a short
review of it (part of an overview of the whole season) that praised its little
philosophical sentences — but as it turned out there were relatively few of
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show is about a sort of amorous ... rectangle (?) between two guys and two
gals. I won&amp;#39;t deny the setting and the mood is nice, but unfortunately the story
gets nowhere pretty fast. A lot of time is spent of repetitions rather than
evolution in the characters&amp;#39; relationship. The conclusion comes out of the blue,
and does not really feel satisfying, or really coherent with what transpired
before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it can just be seen as a realistic (or more realistic than usual) take on
human relationship — with a unmistakable Japanese flair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feels like it could have been so much better if the story had been better
conceived though.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weight Training 7: All The Lifts, All The Time</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-2&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-3&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-4&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-5&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-6&quot;&gt;Six&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s switch things up and talk about my training before it actually takes
place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to rethink my long-term training strategy, but that will require a fair
amount of reading and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, and with the gym reopening, I want to get back into
powerlifting training. The approach I want to try this time is practicing every
lift (bench, squat, deadlift) every workout, thrice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a twist, I would work in different rep ranges during each workout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squat 3x, Bench Press 6x, Deadlift 12x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlift 3x, Squat 6x, Bench Press 12x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bench Press 3x, Deadlift 6x, Squat 12x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve actually been told after this was written but not yet published that this
is an existing training programmation concept: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strongerbyscience.com/daily-undulating-periodization/&quot;&gt;Daily Undulating Periodization
(DUP)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons I want to try this approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t worked with heavy weights in a while due to quarantine (and even
before, I wasn&amp;#39;t working very heavy). I miss it, and I think I could use the
stimulus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The high volume will help me recover my previous level of performance faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hopefully, it could also help me go beyond my previous peak. Powerlifters
programs typically train the lifts more than what I&amp;#39;ve ever been doing. That
was under &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training&quot;&gt;Stronglifts&lt;/a&gt;, and was per 2-week periods: 6x squat, 3x
deadlift, 3x bench. (1) I haven&amp;#39;t trained liked that in more than a year
however.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That&amp;#39;s also how I see most competent powerlifters around me train. (2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternating rep ranges should help relieve the stress of repeating the same
movement pattern over and over, and help develop different &amp;quot;strength
qualities&amp;quot;. (3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practicing the same lift often means there&amp;#39;s less pressure to perform great or
improve the lift during each given workout. It also gives three vectors on
which to improve (one for each rep ranges) for the same lift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s a similar approach to the proven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/531-how-to-build-pure-strength&quot;&gt;5/3/1&lt;/a&gt; program
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.powerliftingtowin.com/beyond-531/&quot;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt;), but which dips in bodybuilding rep ranges (6+)
instead or staying within purely strength-focused rep ranges (1-6).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) That&amp;#39;s not enough deadlift and bench, and in a sense too much squat,
because all these trainings were in the same rep range — at the end of that
period, that was one heavy set of 3 followed by two lighter sets of 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) The guy with the biggest bench press I met (not sure about the exact
number, but he casually benched 160kg for a couple reps) told me he got there by
benching every workout. Clearly it works for some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) It&amp;#39;s difficult to explain, but anyone that has lifted seriously knows that
squat your max for 3 reps feels very different than squatting your max for 12
reps. The difficulty and challenges are not the in same place. The hope is that
the aspect that are most stimulated when working in that rep range will improve
and carry over to the other rep ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the approach also comes with risks, most notably the risk of
increased fatigue because of the increased volume. To tackle this, I&amp;#39;ve made
multiple resolutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be very mindful of fatigue, and don&amp;#39;t try to macho it up. Since every lift is
practiced every workout, there is not less incentive to do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay shy of failure, which takes a big toll on your body. This is standard
training advice, but I&amp;#39;ve never practiced it, as &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training&quot;&gt;Stronglifts&lt;/a&gt; is a
beginner program. (4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, try to stay within the feasible range. Occasionally trying to go
heavier and failing is okay. Or use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niashanks.com/double-progression-method/&quot;&gt;double progression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One question that is not entirely settled: per-workout volume. It&amp;#39;s planned to
adapt this depending on fatigue, but I might dabble in some formal scheme,
drawing inspiration from &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-5/#reactive-training-systems-rts&quot;&gt;Reactive Training
Systems (RTS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another RTS idea: Use pivot blocks (essentially extended deloads with
complementary work) whenever progress stop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And in fact, try to predict when progress will stop by tracking your Time To
Peak (TTP: the number of weeks you can train before progress stops). Curious
to see how that one works out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Some will argue that beginners should also stay shy of failure, which is
fair enough I suppose. I actually have no idea if there is a definitive word
on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;... all the while cutting.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might not be optimal in order to make strength gains, but should be fine as
long as I don&amp;#39;t overtrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rationale is that the strength stuff is fun, and interesting to investigate,
but I don&amp;#39;t attach much value to reaching particular strength milestone. On the
other hand, I do attach some value to getting to a leaner body composition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some more meditations on this, but I will have to wait for another post!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weight Training 6: Training at Home During Quarantine</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-2&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-3&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-4&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-5&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a long overdue post on how I trained at home during quarantine. In fact,
as I write this, I&amp;#39;ve just begun going back to the gym since one week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;training-home&quot;&gt;Training @Home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the quarantine as an opportunity to experiment with at-home training,
something that had been in the back of my mind for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no clear best candidate to adopt for at-home training, I decided to adapt
&lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-5&quot;&gt;my previous training regimen&lt;/a&gt; (based on Jeremy Ethier&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.builtwithscience.com/courses&quot;&gt;Intermediate
Build&lt;/a&gt; program) for home work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In fact, Jeremy ended up releasing an adapted version of his program for home,
which includes barbell, bodyweight and resistance band versions of all workouts.
But that wasn&amp;#39;t available when I started quarantining.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment was pretty successful. I was able to put on some weight, and get
past a sticking point I had between 89 and 90 kgs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact it was a bit too successful. The program calls for 5 workouts a week,
but I ended up burning out after a couple weeks, and scaling back to 3 workouts
a week while keeping the 5-workouts rotation. Probably not the most optimal
thing to do, but eh — choosing exercises is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home training can mean widely different things. I already owned a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B019H12VG8&quot;&gt;pullup bar&lt;/a&gt;
and a couple &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B074MTMMWH&quot;&gt;resistance bands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07D35TXXX&quot;&gt;tubular bands&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, I decided to
invest in a pair of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B0828DJYQR&quot;&gt;adaptable dumbbells&lt;/a&gt;. Those are pretty pricey: the &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot;
(as in both price and potentially, make) version I bought ran me 100€ for each,
while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B078HDGG7H&quot;&gt;original brand product&lt;/a&gt; is 250€. Ultimately, it proved to be a good
investment: they held up until now and proved really invaluable and enabling me
to perform more exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of quarantine I also bought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B078KCM53F/&quot;&gt;suspension band&lt;/a&gt; (also known as
&amp;quot;TRX band&amp;quot;, after the most popular brand). This is super handy for back
workouts, which are othewise a bit awkwards excepted for pullups. Really
recommended if you&amp;#39;re going to work your back at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program went through multiple slight iterations — I&amp;#39;m just going to
reproduce the final version below, with links to demonstrations for all the
exercises. A few comments on its evolution will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-program&quot;&gt;The Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: No rep counts are included. Since I have only limited ability to overload
the movement with weights at home, most of these should simply be &amp;quot;as many as
possible&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2x &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy0aMkLNsKo&quot;&gt;Weighted Calf Raise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;(you can also do them without a raised  surface)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViVhUZGk6i4&quot;&gt;Single Leg Romanian Deadlift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;(I did those with a single weight on the side of the support leg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;evolution&quot;&gt;Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most notable evolution the program went through is that most most exercises
that have two sets used to have three, but I reduced when deloading after
burning out on the early version. Subsequently I simply increase the volume on
those two sets instead of adding a third one. I&amp;#39;m not sure this is the best
thing to do (3 sets is often seen as somewhat of a standard), but the main
benefit was helping get the length of the workouts under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already mentionned, I bought the suspension band only partway through, and
that means that other exercises had to be selected for the back before that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the exercises I tried: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/fYS-rSmedCE?t=346&quot;&gt;towel row&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/mjnseqLiVXM?t=167&quot;&gt;superman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/mjnseqLiVXM?t=40&quot;&gt;back widow&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVQjyeQQDIs&quot;&gt;resistance band seated row&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cszJcRz5UB0&quot;&gt;reverse pushups&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmi9NXKw1fU&quot;&gt;overhand/underhand table
rows&lt;/a&gt;, tubular band face pulls, band-assisted pullups, scapular pullups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also some variation on the other workouts, though less. Most notably I
did some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4mCllu5Qps&quot;&gt;kitchen counter dips&lt;/a&gt;, and some of the exerecises outlined in this
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKdR83QGIcg&quot;&gt;chest workout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;ve said a couple times, this probably isn&amp;#39;t the most optimized home
workout. 5 workouts over 11 days is probably too long of a rotation. There are
too many exercises, and it would be better to have a bit more sets per exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I got positive results out of it, and it was pretty good
given the circumstances. If anything, my biggest success here was to be able to
back down when I felt the onset of fatigue and overtraining — which has been
hard for me in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for what&amp;#39;s next, I&amp;#39;ve started to do all the big lifts (bench, squat &amp;amp;
deadlift) again, three times per week, all the while cutting on a moderate
deficit. This might be a terrible idea, but I&amp;#39;m giving it a try. More on that
soon (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Truffle Tutorial: Adding 1 and 1 Together</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve now been working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby&quot;&gt;TruffleRuby&lt;/a&gt; for about 7 months. TruffleRuby is a Ruby
implementation built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/docs/&quot;&gt;GraalVM&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/docs/Truffle-Framework/user/README&quot;&gt;Truffle API&lt;/a&gt;. Truffle allows
languages to be implemented on top of Graal as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)#Abstract_syntax_tree_interpreters&quot;&gt;AST interpreters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share a little bit of what I learned of Graal and Truffle, so I
decided to write this tutorial, which demonstrates the basics of Truffle through
simplistic examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are setting our ambition very low for this post. We are going to implement
the almost-simplest possible language. It will only be able to add numbers and
strings together. Doing this will teach us about some core principles of
Truffle. Then, we will use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/enterprise/20/guide/reference/ideal-graph-visualizer.html&quot;&gt;Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV)&lt;/a&gt; tool to
inspect the result of compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-graal-and-truffle-do&quot;&gt;What Graal and Truffle Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before entering into the minute details, I want to give you an overview of what
Graal and Truffle actually do, and why it&amp;#39;s interesting to use them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why build your language on Graal/Truffle? The one line answer is that you can
make it go fast, easily. The more dynamic / abstract your language, the more it
will benefit from the optimizations offered by Truffle: writing your own
advanced JIT compiler is not a light undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also get other goodness, such as debugging support for free. There are
two good articles that should sell you on the technology: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.plan99.net/graal-truffle-134d8f28fb69&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Graal &amp;amp; Truffle&amp;quot; by
Mike Hearn&lt;/a&gt; (hype check: not every promise is entirely realized, but it&amp;#39;s
in the works) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/graalvm/graalvm-ten-things-12d9111f307d&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Top 10 Things To Do With GraalVM&amp;quot; by Chris Seaton&lt;/a&gt;
(hype check: this is all real).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for how the technology actually works, the best explanation for Graal is
probably Chris Seaton&amp;#39;s talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/jokerconf17/&quot;&gt;Understanding How GraalVM Works&lt;/a&gt; (a
full transcript with inline slides is available!). This is deep technical
content, clearly explained. It doesn&amp;#39;t cover Truffle, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my own broad overview of how Graal/Truffle makes your code fast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using the Truffle API, Graal (which includes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation&quot;&gt;just in time (JIT)
compiler&lt;/a&gt;) will compile &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_spot_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;hot parts of the AST&lt;/a&gt; to efficient
machine code. In particular, the hot parts of the AST will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation&quot;&gt;partially
evaluated&lt;/a&gt;. While this has multiple performance implications, it will most
notably avoid a lot of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dzone.com/articles/too-fast-too-megamorphic-what&quot;&gt;megamorphic call overhead&lt;/a&gt; that an AST
interpreter would normally suffer from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Truffle API also offers other ways to improve performance. Most notably is
its reliance on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching#Polymorphic_inline_caching&quot;&gt;(polymorphic) inline caching&lt;/a&gt;. In a program, there are
regularities that are hard or impossible to detect statically. For instance,
maybe a function works on different kinds of values, but in practice only ever
receives a single kind. Truffle lets you specify &lt;em&gt;specializations&lt;/em&gt; which handle
a subset of all cases that are allowed to occur. Then, at runtime, Truffle will
generate optimized code only for the specializations that were actually
encountered in practice, and insert a check to verify that we do not encounter
other cases (in which case we need to throw away the compiled code and start the
process again). This is called &lt;em&gt;inline caching&lt;/em&gt; because we cache the encountered
specializations in the AST. We&amp;#39;ll cover the specialization mechanism in detail
in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical use case for inline caching is method lookup: virtual method calls
have a tendency to always be done on an instance of the same class. Using inline
caching, we can store this class, and specialize the code for it, which avoids
repeating the costly method lookup. However, Truffle&amp;#39;s caches are very flexible,
and it&amp;#39;s possible to specialize on arbitrary conditions — depending on what the
language implementer specifies. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/dsl/Specialization.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/dsl/Cached.html&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;
for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Truffle API also offers more advanced utilities to optimize your language,
such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CompilerDirectives.CompilationFinal.html&quot;&gt;compilation final values&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/Assumption.html&quot;&gt;assumptions&lt;/a&gt; (in particular, those two
help improve the result of partial evaluation). We won&amp;#39;t talk about these here,
but maybe some other time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow along with the examples, you&amp;#39;ll need to install GraalVM. In
particular, I used the 20.1.0 version with OpenJDK 11. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/&quot;&gt;download it
here&lt;/a&gt;. Then follow the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/getting-started/&quot;&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;. You can also add
it as a SDK to your IDE, usually you&amp;#39;ll need to point it to the Java home
directory (the thing you&amp;#39;re told to put in &lt;code&gt;JAVA_HOME&lt;/code&gt; in the installation
instructions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that if you&amp;#39;re on macOS and you&amp;#39;re hit with an error that reads
&lt;code&gt;“graalvm-ce-java11-20.1.0” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.&lt;/code&gt; when
trying one of GraalVM&amp;#39;s binaries (&lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;javac&lt;/code&gt;, ...), you can fix the
situation by running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine graalvm-ce-java11-20.1.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Replace &lt;code&gt;graalvm-ce-java11-20.1.0&lt;/code&gt; by the path to the root directory of your
GraalVM installation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll also need the Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV), (again, I used version 20.1.0
for Java 11). IGV is normally part of the (paid/licensed) Entreprise Edition of
GraalVM, but you can evaluate it for free. Be aware that, in principle, the code
you evaluate IGV on cannot be used commercially (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IANAL&quot;&gt;IANAL etc&lt;/a&gt;). You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/downloads/graalvm-downloads.html&quot;&gt;download
it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same as before, if you get an error on macOS, you might need to run the
following (where &lt;code&gt;idealgraphvisualizer&lt;/code&gt; is the directory where you extracted
IGV):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine idealgraphvisualizer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to walk through my whole language example, showing you the code as I
go. However, the entire source is avaiable &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/truffle-tutorial&quot;&gt;on this Github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get started. We&amp;#39;ll use Maven to build the project and pull in the
dependencies. To install it, just use your package manager of choice, or follow
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/install.html&quot;&gt;install instruction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Maven config file for the project (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/truffle-tutorial/blob/master/pom.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pom.xml&lt;/code&gt; 🔗&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

                    &amp;lt;target&amp;gt;11&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/plugins&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/build&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&amp;gt;UTF-8&amp;lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;graalvm.version&amp;gt;20.1.0&amp;lt;/graalvm.version&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/properties&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.truffle&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;truffle-api&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.truffle&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;truffle-dsl-processor&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;provided&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/dependencies&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/project&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing incredibly tricky going on here. Sources go to &lt;code&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;src/main/java&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can burn in hell), we&amp;#39;re using Java version 11, and pulling down
the Truffle API and Truffle annotation processor version 20.1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m calling this project &lt;code&gt;exni&lt;/code&gt; for &amp;quot;ex nihilo&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m cute like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-the-ast&quot;&gt;Building the AST&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to do is to build a simple AST to be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/truffle-tutorial/blob/master/src/exni/nodes/ExniNode.java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExniNode.java&lt;/code&gt; 🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;package exni.nodes;

import com.oracle.truffle.api.frame.VirtualFrame;
import com.oracle.truffle.api.nodes.Node;

public abstract class ExniNode extends Node
{
    /** main execute method */
    public abstract Object execute (VirtualFrame frame);
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll use this as the parent class for all our AST nodes. It inherits from the
Truffle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/Node.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; class itself. The &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; method evaluates the node and returns
a result of type &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;. It takes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/frame/VirtualFrame.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;VirtualFrame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which represents a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack&quot;&gt;stack frame&lt;/a&gt;: that of the &amp;quot;function&amp;quot; (or equivalent concept) to which the node belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; is special in Truffle. Truffle is aware of node methods whose
name start with &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; and will call the appropriate one when it needs to
evaluate the children of another AST node. Which &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; method is appropriate
depends on the requested value type (&lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; being the most general, and
therefore always applicable) as well as available parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s move to the simplest node implementation possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/truffle-tutorial/blob/master/src/exni/nodes/IntLiteralNode.java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;IntLiteralNode.java&lt;/code&gt; 🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;package exni.nodes;

import com.oracle.truffle.api.frame.VirtualFrame;

public final class IntLiteralNode extends ExniNode
{
    public final long value;

    public IntLiteralNode (long value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    @Override public Object execute (VirtualFrame frame) {
        return value;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This node represents an integer literal that appears in source code. We
implement the &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; method to simply return that number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a node for the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; operator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/truffle-tutorial/blob/master/src/exni/nodes/AddNode.java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AddNode.java&lt;/code&gt; 🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;package exni.nodes;

import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Fallback;
import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.NodeChild;
import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.Specialization;
import exni.ExniException;

@NodeChild(&amp;quot;left&amp;quot;)
@NodeChild(&amp;quot;right&amp;quot;)
public abstract class AddNode extends ExniNode
{
    public static AddNode create (ExniNode left, ExniNode right) {
        return AddNodeGen.create(left, right);
    }

    @Specialization protected long addLongs (long left, long right) {
        return left + right;
    }

    @Specialization String addStrings (String left, String right) {
        return left + right;
    }

    @Fallback protected void typeError (Object left, Object right) {
        throw new ExniException(&amp;quot;type error: args must be two longs, or two strings&amp;quot;, this);
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two &lt;code&gt;NodeChild&lt;/code&gt; annotations define children nodes of this AST node. By
default, these have the type of the superclass (&lt;code&gt;ExniNode&lt;/code&gt; in this case), but
it&amp;#39;s also possible to specify the type explicitly with the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; annotation
element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This class is abstract, but Truffle will generate a concrete implementation for
us, named &lt;code&gt;AddNodeGen&lt;/code&gt;. If you load &lt;a href=&quot;exni-github&quot;&gt;the project&lt;/a&gt; in your IDE, you
can navigate there easily (import the Maven project and build first). We will
examine this class shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic of the class is implemented using the &lt;em&gt;specialization system&lt;/em&gt;. Instead
of overriding the &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; method(s), we mark a series of method with the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/dsl/Specialization.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Specialization&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/dsl/Fallback.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Fallback&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that when the node is executed, Truffle will pick the first matching
specialization and run it. There are two criteria used when matching
specializations: the type of its parameters and additionals conditions specified
by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/dsl/Specialization.html#guards--&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;guards&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; annotation element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple node, so it only has two specializations and a fallback,
one for when both values are &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt; (Truffle will automatically perform unboxing
whenever required), and one for when both values are strings. Additionally,
there is a fallback specialization. A fallback specialization is a
specialization that will always match when (and only when) no other
specialization does. In this case, we just throw an type error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of &lt;code&gt;ExniException&lt;/code&gt; is irrelevant, excepted that all
exceptions thrown during guest language execution must implement
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/TruffleException.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TruffleException&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — excepted those exceptions that represent errors in the
implementation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the names of the specialization methods are irrelevant, they could
have been anything, including the same name (as long as it generates distinct
method overloads, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;specializations-under-the-hood&quot;&gt;Specializations: Under The Hood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at the class generated by Truffle to implement our abstract
&lt;code&gt;AddNode&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/norswap/a235123a4aa3a236fbdeb653ea389362#file-addnodegen-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AddNodeGen 🔗&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                return addLongs(leftValue_, rightValue_);
            }
        }
        if (leftValue instanceof String) {

                return addStrings(leftValue_, rightValue_);
            }
        }
        this.state_ = state = state | 0b100 /* add-active typeError(Object, Object) */;
        typeError(leftValue, rightValue);
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public NodeCost getCost() { /* ... */ }

    private static boolean fallbackGuard_(int state, Object leftValue, Object rightValue) {
        if (((state &amp;amp; 0b1)) == 0 /* is-not-active addLongs(long, long) */ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; leftValue instanceof Long &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rightValue instanceof Long) {
            return false;
        }
        if (((state &amp;amp; 0b10)) == 0 /* is-not-active addStrings(String, String) */ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; leftValue instanceof String &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rightValue instanceof String) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static AddNode create(ExniNode left, ExniNode right) {
        return new AddNodeGen(left, right);
    }

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has three fields. The first two were generated by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/dsl/NodeChild.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NodeChild&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
annotations. There is also a &lt;code&gt;create&lt;/code&gt; method at the bottom, which can be used to
get create an instance of &lt;code&gt;AddNode&lt;/code&gt; if given its two children. The third field
(&lt;code&gt;state_&lt;/code&gt;) keeps track of what specializations are active for the node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active specializations? What does that even mean? Well, whenever a
specialization is first used, it becomes active. One node can have multiple
specializations active at the same time. A new node starts with no active
specializations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, let&amp;#39;s imagine a small syntax and a dummy program for our language:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def add(x, y)
    return x + y; // AddNode 1

add(1, 2)
add(&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;)
1 + 2 // AddNode 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used comments to mark the two locations where an &lt;code&gt;AddNode&lt;/code&gt; is generated.
&lt;code&gt;AddNode 1&lt;/code&gt; will see both integer and string values, and so both specializations
will become active. &lt;code&gt;AddNode 2&lt;/code&gt;, on the other hand, will only ever see integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do we need to distinguish between active and inactive specializations?
Doing so helps Graal&amp;#39;s JIT compiler generate better compiled code. Whenever the
node has to be JIT-compiled, Graal will only emit machine code for the
specializations that have been activated. Having less possibilities has multiple
benefits. First there are less cases to check. Second, the reduced set of
possibilities may enable further optimizations (especially when there is only a
single active specialization). Finally, all else being equal, shorter code is
generally faster (more efficient cache utilisation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises one more question: what happens if, after generating compiled code,
we encounter a case covered by a specialization that hasn&amp;#39;t been activated yet?
In that case, the compiled code is invalidated, and the new specialization is
activated. New compiled code may subsequently be generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s go back to the code. Truffle has automatically generated the &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;
method that was left abstract (in &lt;code&gt;ExniNode&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;AddNode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#39;s superclass). It has
also generated an &lt;code&gt;executeAndSpecialize&lt;/code&gt; method that &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; calls. Relating
to our previous discussion, &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; should be understood as running the active
specializations, while &lt;code&gt;executeAndSpecialize&lt;/code&gt; is responsible to activate new
specializations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; starts by executing the two children nodes. Then, if our &lt;code&gt;addLongs&lt;/code&gt;
specialization is active, and if both resulting values can be cast to &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, it
calls &lt;code&gt;AddNode#addLongs&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, if our &lt;code&gt;addStrings&lt;/code&gt; specialization is
active and if the values can be cast to &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, it calls &lt;code&gt;AddNode#addStrings&lt;/code&gt;.
If that&amp;#39;s not possible either, it calls
&lt;code&gt;CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate()&lt;/code&gt; and then
&lt;code&gt;executeAndSpecialize&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;executeAndSpecialize&lt;/code&gt; does almost the same thing, but does not check for
activated specializations, only for the specific conditions in which a
specialization may apply. Additionally, it activates any specialization it
calls. Finally, if none of the two specialization matches, it calls our fallback
specialization &lt;code&gt;AddNode#typeError&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might think from this that fallback specializations may never be
activated. This is not so. The only reason that &lt;code&gt;typeError&lt;/code&gt; does not appear in
&lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; is that its return type (&lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;) is incompatible with that of
&lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;). If we wanted the specialization to be activable, we could
change its return type to &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;. Since it is an extraordinary error
condition, I chose not do that here. I encourage you to try it and check that
the generated code changed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note you can observe similar effects when multiple &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; methods have
different type parameters. The &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; methods will be JIT-compiled
separately, which can lead to more efficient code for the method whose signature
is more restrictive (as it doesn&amp;#39;t have to include the activated specializations
that don&amp;#39;t match the signature).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-magic-happens&quot;&gt;How the Magic Happens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is the logic split between &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;executeAndSpecialize&lt;/code&gt;? It&amp;#39;s
because &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; is what will become JIT-compiled. All its calls to
specializations are guarded by conditions on &lt;code&gt;_state&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;_state&lt;/code&gt; is marked with
&lt;code&gt;CompilationFinal&lt;/code&gt; annotation. This annotation tells Truffle to consider that
the field is effectively final for partial evaluation and compilation purposes.
In practice, this means that calls to inactive specializations will be pruned
from the compiled code, hence only retaining the active specializations. It&amp;#39;s
exactly what we want to get the benefits I outlined a bit before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also explains why specialization activation is relegated to
&lt;code&gt;executeAndSpecialize&lt;/code&gt;. That method will never be compiled, because it is only
called from the &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; methods, and always preceded by a call to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CompilerDirectives.html#transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate--&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which tells Truffle to
invalidate the current compiled code for the method! Truffle is aware of this,
and so will never inline &lt;code&gt;executeAndSpecialized&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CompilerDirectives.html#transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate--&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; call is also
what ensures that we discard the current compiled code when a new specialization
becomes active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn more about the specialization system in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333510523_Truffle_DSL_A_DSL_for_Building_Self-Optimizing_AST_Interpreters&quot;&gt;Christian Hummer&amp;#39;s master
thesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;running&quot;&gt;Running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we have our grand addition/concatenation node. Let&amp;#39;s actually use it.
Here is our main class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/truffle-tutorial/blob/master/src/exni/ExniMain.java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExniMain&lt;/code&gt; 🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;package exni;

import com.oracle.truffle.api.Truffle;
import exni.nodes.AddNode;
import exni.nodes.IntLiteralNode;
import exni.nodes.ExniRootNode;

public abstract class ExniMain
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        var add = AddNode.create(new IntLiteralNode(1), new IntLiteralNode(2));
        var root = new ExniRootNode(add);
        var target = Truffle.getRuntime().createCallTarget(root);

        // Uncomment this in order to use a CountNode instead of an AddNode.
        // target = Truffle.getRuntime().createCallTarget(new MainNode(new CountNode()));

        System.out.println(target.call());

        // Uncomment this in order to force the compilation of the node.
        // while (true) target.call();
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry about the &amp;quot;uncomment&amp;quot; bit. We&amp;#39;ll get to those later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We construct our &lt;code&gt;AddNode&lt;/code&gt; as expected, but then we wrap it into a
&lt;code&gt;ExniRootNode&lt;/code&gt;. This is an implementation of the Truffle &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/RootNode.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RootNode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; class. In
Truffle, runnable nodes belong to a tree with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/RootNode.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RootNode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the root. For
instance, there is typically one &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/RootNode.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RootNode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; per function definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/RootNode.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RootNode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also holds a reference to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/frame/FrameDescriptor.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FrameDescriptor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that describes the
parameters expected by the node (in the case of a function definition: the
function&amp;#39;s parameters). We do not need to specify this here, since our addition
expression does not take parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExniRootNode&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t do anything fancy by itself: it just wraps an &lt;code&gt;ExniNode&lt;/code&gt;,
and extends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/nodes/RootNode.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RootNode&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/truffle-tutorial/blob/master/src/exni/ExniRootNode.java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ExniRootNode&lt;/code&gt; 🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;package exni.nodes;

import com.oracle.truffle.api.frame.VirtualFrame;
import com.oracle.truffle.api.nodes.RootNode;

public final class ExniRootNode extends RootNode
{
    @SuppressWarnings(&amp;quot;FieldMayBeFinal&amp;quot;)
    private @Child ExniNode root;

    public ExniRootNode(ExniNode root) {
        super(null);
        this.root = root;
    }

    @Override public Object execute (VirtualFrame frame) {
        return root.execute(frame);
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to call
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/TruffleRuntime.html#createCallTarget-com.oracle.truffle.api.nodes.RootNode-&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Truffle.getRuntime().createCallTarget(root)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to create a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CallTarget.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallTarget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The call target represents something you can call (in this case,
it&amp;#39;s our add expression).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in general, expressions don&amp;#39;t have an associated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CallTarget.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallTarget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s
typically reserved for callable things like functions and methods. But our
language does not have those, and we need a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CallTarget.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallTarget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to run the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CallTarget.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallTarget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instead of call the node&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; method directly so
that Truffle may perform some bookkeeping on the call. In particular, the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CallTarget.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallTarget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; records how often our node is called, so that Truffle may decide
when to JIT-compile it. It can also be used for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentation_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;instrumentation&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, it
wires up the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CallTarget.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallTarget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so that it will automatically create an object
representing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack&quot;&gt;stack frame&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/frame/VirtualFrame.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;VirtualFrame&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; argument taken by our
various &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt; methods) when called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that is left to do is to invoke &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CallTarget.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallTarget#call&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and print
the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run this after building with Maven, you can use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;M2=$HOME/.m2/repository
java \
    -Dtruffle.class.path.append=target/classes \
    --add-exports org.graalvm.truffle/com.oracle.truffle.api.nodes=ALL-UNNAMED  \
    --add-exports org.graalvm.truffle/com.oracle.truffle.api=ALL-UNNAMED \
    -classpath target/classes:$M2/org/graalvm/truffle/truffle-api/20.1.0/truffle-api-20.1.0.jar:$M2/org/graalvm/sdk/graal-sdk/20.1.0/graal-sdk-20.1.0.jar \
    exni.ExniMain&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple practical points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need to be at the repository&amp;#39;s root&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt; must point to the GraalVM version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$M2&lt;/code&gt; should point to your m2 repository (by default it&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.m2/repository&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can configure your IDE to run this instead, you&amp;#39;ll just need to specify
the main class and all the other non-classpath arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget to run this with GraalVM&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt;! It will run with other &lt;code&gt;java&lt;/code&gt;
but Truffle nodes won&amp;#39;t be compiled specially.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, your console should print the glorious number 3!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra technical note: The &lt;code&gt;add-exports&lt;/code&gt; arguments are needed because classes
in &lt;code&gt;com.oracle.truffle.api&lt;/code&gt; need to be loaded via Truffle&amp;#39;s own class loader.
The &lt;code&gt;add-exports&lt;/code&gt; arguments ensure that the class loader associated with the
module is used. Similarly, defining &lt;code&gt;truffle.class.path.append&lt;/code&gt; enables that
classloader to find our own node classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;igv&quot;&gt;IGV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run IGV, simply run the &lt;code&gt;bin/idealgraphvisualizer&lt;/code&gt; in your IGV install
directory (just wherever you unzipped the downloaded archive). This will tie up
the console in which IGV is run — if you it to run in the background, I
recommend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/screen.1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;screen -dm -S igv bin/idealgraphvisualizer
screen -r igv # to attach to the screen&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you&amp;#39;ll need to configure your java run command in order for it to generate
compilation graphs and send them to IGV. You can achieve this by adding the
following flags to your Java command: &lt;code&gt;-Dgraal.Dump=Truffle -Dgraal.PrintGraph=Network&lt;/code&gt;. Full command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;M2=$HOME/.m2/repository
java \
    -Dtruffle.class.path.append=target/classes \
    --add-exports org.graalvm.truffle/com.oracle.truffle.api.nodes=ALL-UNNAMED  \
    --add-exports org.graalvm.truffle/com.oracle.truffle.api=ALL-UNNAMED \
    -classpath target/classes:$M2/org/graalvm/truffle/truffle-api/20.1.0/truffle-api-20.1.0.jar:$M2/org/graalvm/sdk/graal-sdk/20.1.0/graal-sdk-20.1.0.jar \
    -Dgraal.Dump=Truffle \
    -Dgraal.PrintGraph=Network \
    exni.ExniMain&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Dump=Truffle&lt;/code&gt; option means to only dump graphs relevant to analysing
Truffle&amp;#39;s performance (for instance it won&amp;#39;t include graphs for compiled Java
code that is not related to Truffle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PrintGraph=Network&lt;/code&gt; option means to send the graphs directly to a running
IGV over the network. If you omit this, it will default to dumping the graphs as
files in &lt;code&gt;graal_dumps/&lt;/code&gt; in the working directory, and you can open those later
from IGV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These flags are documented on Graal&amp;#39;s git repository &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/compiler/src/org.graalvm.compiler.debug/src/org/graalvm/compiler/debug/doc-files&quot;&gt;here
(master)&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/32cd3db91fe4a141ee3016ac18b0f4cc9f51e447/compiler/src/org.graalvm.compiler.debug/src/org/graalvm/compiler/debug/doc-files&quot;&gt;future-proof(er), commit-specific
link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IGV lets you inspect the result of JIT compilation. Our code so far is very
simple, and does not trigger JIT compilation. However, we can trigger
compilation simply by calling our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CallTarget.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallTarget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; withing an infinite loop
(&lt;code&gt;while (true) target.call();&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that we said that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/CallTarget.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CallTarget&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; counts calls in order to decide what
to optimize? You will now see it&amp;#39;s true: calling inside a loop causes the
counter to cross the threshold for compilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run it, you should now see something like this in IGV:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;centered&quot; src=&quot;left_sidebar.png&quot; width=&quot;400rem&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you select the AST graph, you&amp;#39;ll see this, which is exactly the node hiearchy
we build in our main class:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;centered&quot; src=&quot;ast_sum.png&quot; width=&quot;300rem&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;call tree&amp;quot; graph is not interesting because our nodes do not contain a
guest language function call (our language doesn&amp;#39;t even have those).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;Graal Graphs&amp;quot; section contains graphs at various stages of the compilation
process. We&amp;#39;ll be particularly interested in &amp;quot;Before phase Lowering&amp;quot; which
contains the graphs obtained after all of Truffle&amp;#39;s optimizations have been run
(GraalMV still run generic optimizations after this however). In this case,
you&amp;#39;ll see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;centered&quot; src=&quot;graph_sum_truffle.png&quot; width=&quot;500rem&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is to say, almost nothing! The compiler was smart and the addition of two
constants was completely optimized away. Do you see that small &lt;code&gt;62&lt;/code&gt; node? &lt;code&gt;C(3)&lt;/code&gt;
means &amp;quot;constant with value 3&amp;quot; and that&amp;#39;s the result of our addition. At this
stage, it still needs to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html&quot;&gt;box&lt;/a&gt; that value though. But if you look to any further
graph, you&amp;#39;ll see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;centered&quot; src=&quot;graph_sum_further.png&quot; width=&quot;400rem&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the boxing operation is a constant instance of &lt;code&gt;Long&lt;/code&gt;, so we can
eliminate the boxing operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may wonder why this does not get optimized even further. After all, the
return value is never used. The answer is that the logic that calls the call
target (&lt;code&gt;target.call()&lt;/code&gt;) is quite complex and therefore cannot be optimized
away. You can actually get to see the graph for that by replacing the
&lt;code&gt;-Dgraal.Dump=Truffle&lt;/code&gt; flag by &lt;code&gt;-Dgraal.Dump=:1&lt;/code&gt; and looking for the code of the
main method (&lt;code&gt;exni.ExniMain.main&lt;/code&gt;). You can also move the loop to another method
if you want to get rid of the part of the graph that corresponds to the
construction of the AST. It looks &lt;a href=&quot;graph_main.png&quot;&gt;something like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can note that calling the call target within a loop is not a great idea.
We could probably see that our &lt;code&gt;AddNode&lt;/code&gt; gets optimized away completely if we
implemented a loop in the guest language itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-slightly-harder-graph-and-what-does-it-mean-anyway&quot;&gt;A slightly harder graph, and what does it mean, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so let&amp;#39;s see some actual graphs. We&amp;#39;ll create a new node that doesn&amp;#39;t
optimize away. This node will be a counter that updates a public field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/truffle-tutorial/blob/master/src/exni/nodes/CountNode.java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CountNode&lt;/code&gt; 🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;package exni.nodes;

import com.oracle.truffle.api.frame.VirtualFrame;

public final class CountNode extends ExniNode {

    public long counter;

    @Override public Object execute (VirtualFrame frame) {
        return counter++;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we&amp;#39;ll never read the counter, the field is public and the compiler
cannot prove that it won&amp;#39;t be read, so it has to be dutifully incremented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you modify the main method to run this node instead, and go to the graphs
(still &amp;quot;Before phase Lowering&amp;quot;) — click for full size version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;graph_counter_full.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;centered&quot; src=&quot;graph_counter_full.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, all the green stuff is &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ll be honest: I&amp;#39;m not too sure what
&amp;quot;state&amp;quot; is supposed to be in general, but in this case (and in conjunction with
grey boxes), it shows you a couple of the methods invoked to start the node&amp;#39;s
execution, as well as relevant parameter to these methods. In particular, node
21 shows an instance of Truffle&amp;#39;s internal &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/7980245f92d00f4b6c38688d46f0a586ec397fde/compiler/src/org.graalvm.compiler.truffle.runtime/src/org/graalvm/compiler/truffle/runtime/FrameWithoutBoxing.java&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FrameWithoutBoxing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; class, and all
the &lt;code&gt;VirtualArray&lt;/code&gt; nodes to the right of that are its fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you can hide the state in the &amp;quot;Filters&amp;quot; panel on the right in IGV. You
could also hit &amp;quot;Remove floating&amp;quot; to get rid of the grey boxes, but I want to
keep node 44 (+). Instead I&amp;#39;ve hidden the other grey boxes manually, and we&amp;#39;re
left with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;centered&quot; src=&quot;graph_counter_simple.png&quot; width=&quot;550rem&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fairly simple to understand: our node loads the &lt;code&gt;counter&lt;/code&gt; field in node
41, and adds 1 to it in node 44. Notice how one operand comes from the blue
line, while the other is given by the small box 43 on top: &lt;code&gt;C(1) i64&lt;/code&gt; means that
the operand is the constant 1, which is a 64-bits integer. We store the result
of this operation back into the field in node 42. Notice how node 41 has a line
going to node 44 and one line going to node 72 (Box), which is the return value?
That&amp;#39;s because we used &lt;code&gt;return counter++&lt;/code&gt; (and not &lt;code&gt;return ++counter&lt;/code&gt;): the node
evaluates to the pre-incremented value!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this explanation, you can see that blue lines represent data flow: a blue
line going down means the data coming out of the higher node is being used by
the lower node. There is also a thick red line: that represents control flow,
i.e. it determines what operations happen before which others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve barely scratched the surface of Graal graphs here (we haven&amp;#39;t even talked
about conditionals and loops). If you want to know more, I highly recommend
these two writeups by Chris Seaton (the first one is essentially a much shorter
teaser version of the second one, which you really ought to read in full if
you&amp;#39;re going to work with IGV):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-further&quot;&gt;Going Further&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it for today! I have some extra material that was cut from this article
that I might rework and post in a couple weeks. Namely, it covers how to set up
the boilerplate to create a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/com/oracle/truffle/api/TruffleLanguage.html&quot;&gt;Truffle guest language&lt;/a&gt; and how to implement
loops inside the guest language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about Graal &amp;amp; Truffle, here a few pointers on where to
find information &amp;amp; documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333510523_Truffle_DSL_A_DSL_for_Building_Self-Optimizing_AST_Interpreters&quot;&gt;Christian Hummer&amp;#39;s master thesis&lt;/a&gt; document the Truffle DSL,
i.e. how to actually use Truffle. It&amp;#39;s very clearly written and if you&amp;#39;re
going to jump on the Truffle bandwagon, you really ought to read chapters 2
and 3. This will give you a good understanding of the principles behind the
Truffle DSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graalvm.org/truffle/javadoc/&quot;&gt;The Truffle Javadoc&lt;/a&gt; is very decent, but it will rarely tell you the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; of
things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graalvm/simplelanguage&quot;&gt;SimpleLanguage example&lt;/a&gt; is a full language implemented with a lot of
comments as an example of how things should generally be done in Truffle. It&amp;#39;s
the main ressource on how to actually do the advanced stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also encourage you to experiment with Truffle directly (showing you how was
the whole point of this article)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, I want to thank my amazing and talented colleagues at Oracle, who
patiently answer my many questions, and in particular Benoit Daloze — for
teaching me most of what I know about Truffle, Christian Humer — for always
helping wherever Truffle is concerned, and Boris Spasojevic for supplying very
helpful feedback on the present article.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Animes, Shows &amp; Movies Reviews 6</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/&quot;&gt;One&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/more-anime/&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/even-more-anime/&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-4&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-5&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;violet-evergarden&quot;&gt;Violet Evergarden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;violet-evergarden.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew this one by name, though I didn&amp;#39;t know what it was about. We
binged-watched in two sittings with a few friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the word I dimly recall being associated with Violet Evergarden is
&amp;quot;poetry&amp;quot;. And I can understand it. It looks georgeous, and it&amp;#39;s also sentimental
without being overly hokey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the show&amp;#39;s perspective is uniquely interesting: we following a character
(Violet) that starts of as completely emotionally imature (in the sense of
wholly unaware what emotions are, and how they affect her and others) in a
journey of emotional discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-hero-academia-season-4&quot;&gt;My Hero Academia Season 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/even-more-anime/#my-hero-academia-season-3&quot;&gt;Season 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/more-anime/#my-hero-academia&quot;&gt;Season 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Hero Academia has been one of my favorite anime, and it&amp;#39;s still great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, this season is perhaps the weakest so far (but still strong in
absolute terms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My criticism here is that the arcs are too drawn out, some episodes almost
bordering on being fillers. Not reeeeally, but what I mean is this: One of Hero
Academia&amp;#39;s strength is being relatively earnest, and clear with its message.
It&amp;#39;s going to tell you what it wants to say. In this season, they did that, but
also — or so it felt to me — occasionally beat you over the head with it. I&amp;#39;m
notably thinking of a whole episode where the whole point is to affirm how much
certain characters care about saving another character, in a way that isn&amp;#39;t very
interesting. And generally, things could have been condensed more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this criticism holds both for the first longer, &amp;quot;heavier&amp;quot; arc,
and for the second shorter more light-hearted arc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;idinvaded&quot;&gt;ID:Invaded&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;id-invaded.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ID: Invaded was a really good surprise of a show. It&amp;#39;s part murder-mystery, part
Matrix/Inception-style techno-thriller, part revenge flick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I appreciated most about the show is how it dealt out information
sparingly, keeping you guessing at the nature of things, without ever being
confusing, nor relying on information dumps. The pacing is also pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s even (at least on one occasion) really touching. And with only 13 episodes,
it&amp;#39;s damn short. A perfect binge-watching candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stranger-things-season-3&quot;&gt;Stranger Things, Season 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had watched season 1 and season 2 (but not reviewed them on here, I only did
anime back then), and enjoyed them a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Season 3 is, mostly, more of the same. The narrative structure is very similar.
I maybe felt that it took a bit too long to set things up, to get to the point
where our heroes are actually active rather than clueless. But maybe it was like
that for previous seasons too and I forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ending redeems whatever slack the start may have. And what a sucker punch of
an ending that is! I&amp;#39;m glad season 4 has been confirmed and some things are
hinted at, otherwise I&amp;#39;d have been outraged that the series end on that note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also mildly annoyed at a lot of conflict between character without much
stakes or interestingness going on — that&amp;#39;s not the wholesomeness I look for in
Stranger Things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: good humanization of a certain character towards the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big like on Maya Hawke&amp;#39;s new character, Robin. Steve Harrington remains my
favorite character. The parts with them, Dustin and Erica are the best of the
season in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;infinite-dendrogram&quot;&gt;Infinite Dendrogram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another watch-to-pass-time isekai. Honestly, it ended up better than I
expected, without never really approaching greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s something off about the thing. An artificiality that makes you think
that this is the thing that someones setting out to write an isekai could come
up with. I wish I was articulate enough to point out why the anime doesn&amp;#39;t quite
work and is hard to take completely at face value. It feels like the trappings
of the genre get in the way of telling a good story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it&amp;#39;s not bad. I finished it and enjoyed the ride for what it
was. From the initial reaction I&amp;#39;ve seen online, I thing this anime will largely
be overlooked and under-rated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is certainly not worse than &lt;a href=&quot;/even-more-anime/#that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime&quot;&gt;Slime&lt;/a&gt;, and in many ways, better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll have more to say about this in the review for &lt;a href=&quot;#samurai-champloo&quot;&gt;Samurai Champloo&lt;/a&gt;, but if
there&amp;#39;s at least something good you can say about Infinite Dendrogram is that it
takes itself earnestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;castlevania-all-3-seasons&quot;&gt;Castlevania (all 3 seasons)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;castlevania.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castlevania, the Netflix-produced American anime, was on the edge of my
consciousness for a long time, though I didn&amp;#39;t what it was in substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the hype of season 3, I finally gave it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First shock: it&amp;#39;s much shorter than one would expect. Season 1 is almost a
pilot, only 4 episodes. Season 2 has 8 and season 3 has 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-wise, I must concede it&amp;#39;s pretty good, though I think it fell short of
what it could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without spoiling, there are events in season 2 happening much too soon in my
opinion. The shows does play fast and loose with its premise, and I think that&amp;#39;s
a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In season 3, I thought one of the narrative arcs of the season (following a
certain vampire) was completely useless and ex machina. I liked the entailed
character development, but there were better, subtler, more believable ways to
get there. Fortunately it&amp;#39;s also very short in screen time (which is perhaps
also one of the reason it fails to work).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, we are presented with a compelling universe, interesting characters,
some mysteries to unravel. I wouldn&amp;#39;t add it to the hallowed list of the
must-watch, but it&amp;#39;s a solid recommendation from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, this is an American production, but I watched it with the
Japanese dub. I found the English dub rather awkward. I noticed the fact it&amp;#39;s a
dub (and the lipsync is thus off) a lot, whereas I don&amp;#39;t in Japanese (simply due
to being unfamiliar with the language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;samurai-champloo&quot;&gt;Samurai Champloo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I started binge watched with friends. I think we saw 7 or 8
episodes. After that I decided not to continue watching it, I had other things
that needed doing and I wasn&amp;#39;t hyped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This anime is directed by Shinichiro Watanabe (*), as his next anime after &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#cowboy-bebop&quot;&gt;Cowboy
Bebop&lt;/a&gt;. Excerpting my own &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#cowboy-bebop&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My impression of Cowboy Bebop is that it&amp;#39;s an impressive anime — one with
mature themes and a real reflection — which happens to be buried in a heap of
goofy filler.
[...]
Still, if you manage to power through the initial filler (I almost didn&amp;#39;t), I
don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;ll regret watching Cowboy Bebop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(*) Interestingly, Watanabe is also the director of &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-4/#carole--tuesday&quot;&gt;Carole &amp;amp; Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, another
thing I dropped though I found it to be quite good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having only watched 7 episodes of Samurai Champloo, it&amp;#39;s hard to say whether it
would be the same or not. The &lt;em&gt;goofy&lt;/em&gt; filler is there all right, and in spades.
Would the story take a turn for the serious towards the end? I must imagine it
would. But I&amp;#39;m not incredibly motivated to continue right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue with my non-motivation, besides the uncertainty that it gets better,
is the characters. They&amp;#39;re not bad, but Mugen and Jin lack the aesthetic, almost
mystical, charism of Spike Spiegel. &amp;quot;Brave girl&amp;quot; Fuu is less interseting than
emotionally-stunted vixen Faye Valentine (though I do expect the rest of the
series has character development for her in relation with this sunflower
samurai).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ll be back to Samurais Champloo, if only by curiosity. It does feel
like I&amp;#39;ve got better things to watch right now however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samurai Champloo is an interesting data point on my own taste. Clearly, I&amp;#39;m not
into &amp;quot;goofy&amp;quot; story. In both Cowboy Bebop and this, the characters are somewhat
loveable, and somewhat dumb, and can&amp;#39;t help but to keep losing. The problem is,
I don&amp;#39;t find that very funny, and it makes for a poor story. It always circles
back to the same spot, nothing is learned, so character development is absent.
The stakes never move. Cowboy Bebop has a poignant story (and ending), but it
gets condensed in maybe four or five episodes worth of content, in a 26-episodes
series (some of those other episodes are genuinely good too though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But additionally, I think what bothers me greatly is that it makes me feel like
the story does not take itself seriously. It&amp;#39;s not earnest. It&amp;#39;s an unfunny
comedy, when what I want out of it is a thriller, an epic or a drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;m a sucker for earnestness on the other hand. It&amp;#39;s why I watched the
whole of &lt;a href=&quot;#infinite-dendrogram&quot;&gt;Infinite Dendrogram&lt;/a&gt;. Objectively, it&amp;#39;s of lesser quality than Samurai
Champloo. But story never fails to take itself seriously (something that I think
many people will count as a mark &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; it). But in all honesty, if Samurai
Champloo was airing weekly, I probably would have watched it all too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mo-dao-zu-shi&quot;&gt;Mo Dao Zu Shi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a popular Chinese anime (a &lt;em&gt;donghua&lt;/em&gt;) — honestly, the only dongua I&amp;#39;ve
ever heard about. Plot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the grandmaster who founded the Demonic Sect, Wei Wuxian roamed the world
in his wanton ways, hated by millions for the crimes he was accused. In the
end, he was stabbed in the back by his sworn brother Jiang Cheng and killed by
the vicious ghosts he controlled when the cultivation clans attacked his
stronghold to kill him. After 13 years, he is summoned into the body of a
lunatic called Mo Xuanyu, who was rejected by his clan and bullied by his
family, therefore sacrificing his own body to Wei Wuxian so he could avenge
him. He&amp;#39;ll soon meet a famous cultivator from his past, Lan Wangji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will soon face a series of events that will take them to discover the
truth behind the tragic events that led to the death of many people and Wei
Wuxian himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped it after 2 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imUXzLeU__Y&quot;&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt; it looked a stylish &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-4/#demon-slayer&quot;&gt;Demon Slayer&lt;/a&gt; but more
earnest and noir. In reality, the first two episodes are mostly comprised of
characters bickering. It&amp;#39;s 30 minutes for an episode, so that&amp;#39;s 1 hours of
mostly bickering and some cool combat mixed in... and absolutely no reason to
care about the story whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really though. In one hour of play time, the main character gets reincarnated
(that takes all of two minutes) then we are not given a single reason to really
care about him, or Lan Wangji which is the only other character of consequence
introduced. No real mystery is implanted either other than what is delivered as
backstory exposition: Wei Wuxian was this warlock master, who apparently did
some horrible things. What? Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second huge gripe is this: If Wei Wuxian was this badass warlock king, then
why as he is reincarnated in the body of a boy, does he take a definitely
un-badass, and in fact boyish personality? I guess that&amp;#39;s the only harp on the
mystery we get: how did someone with an apparently lame and kind disposition (he
does take some pain to save people) do such horrible things?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah. It wasn&amp;#39;t enjoyable viewing, and I was given no reason to keep
watching, so I dropped it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the real mystery is why it has a 8.5 rating &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/anime/37208/Mo_Dao_Zu_Shi&quot;&gt;on
MyAnimeList&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did parse the reviews in search for something that wasn&amp;#39;t a 10 or a 9 to find
some nuanced explanation but didn&amp;#39;t found anything that explains it. The 10 and
9 review mostly praise the aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this however, which I&amp;#39;ll confirm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the characters are less impressive. One of my biggest pet
peeves is same facing. Same facing is when an artist consistently draws the
same kind of face and the only way to distinguish them apart is from their
hair or clothing. MDZS is very guilty of this. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell anyone apart
because all the people from the same sect wore the same clothes and everyone
has the same face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rezero-frozen-bonds&quot;&gt;Re:Zero Frozen Bonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/even-more-anime/#rezero&quot;&gt;Season 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big coronavirus-induced disappointement this season was that Re:Zero season 2
was pushed back. However there is an OVA that came out at the end of 2019. Since
I really like Re:Zero, it was a no brainer to watch that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ... it kinda sucks. I&amp;#39;m sure real fans will enjoy learning about the tiny
sliver of backstory we&amp;#39;re given here. But as a story on its own, it&amp;#39;s nothing to
write home about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, the thing just lacks &lt;em&gt;interestingness&lt;/em&gt;. The plot is basically (1)
people are afraid of Emilia, who is an unreasonably nice person, (2) an ennemy
appear, it has to be defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the backstory without wasting your time, go read a summary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;konosuba-legend-of-crimson&quot;&gt;Konosuba!: Legend of Crimson&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;konosuba-crimson.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a movie (I had to look it up, but the main distinction seems to be that
a movie airs in theaters, while an OVA does not), this time for &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#konosuba&quot;&gt;Konosuba!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was very unlike the Re:Zero OVA, and I enjoyed it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a spot on transcription of the show&amp;#39;s humor and feeling to a movie. It&amp;#39;s
also paced like a good &lt;em&gt;movie&lt;/em&gt;: it avoids the trap of feeling like a drawn-out
episode, or like something that would breathe better as a longer string of
episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I&amp;#39;d forgotten how much I enjoyed Konosuba!, so this was really a nice
surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise really has a unique texture to it. It&amp;#39;s quite funny in its own
unique way, but — despite the show never being overtly sentimal — it&amp;#39;s also warm
and fuzzy, when the characters reveal their underlying camaraderie in-between
bouts of bickering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, Konosuba! has a lot of the things I said I disliked in other
shows: bickering (&lt;a href=&quot;#mo-dao-zu-shi&quot;&gt;Mo Dao Zu Shi&lt;/a&gt;), the protagonist being loveable/dumb losers
(&lt;a href=&quot;#samurai-champloo&quot;&gt;Samurai Champloo&lt;/a&gt;), though crucially, in Konosuba! they do ultimately win and
it can be argued they do progress, albeit slowly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the lesson is that everything can work under the right frame, and that
describing aesthetics and &amp;quot;texture&amp;quot; is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize I haven&amp;#39;t said much about the movie itself, but really it&amp;#39;s Konosuba!.
If you enjoy the show, you&amp;#39;ll enjoy the movie just as much. Very recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;promare&quot;&gt;Promare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;promare.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fan of &lt;a href=&quot;/more-anime/#kill-la-kill&quot;&gt;Kill la Kill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#gurren-lagann&quot;&gt;Gurren Lagann&lt;/a&gt;, I was naturally excited to see a
new movie featuring the same director and head writer (Hiroyuki Imaishi &amp;amp; Kazuki
Nakashima), especially since Promare is blatantly a riff on the same genre.
Heck, the main character (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.be/search?q=promare+galo&amp;amp;tbm=isch&quot;&gt;Galo&lt;/a&gt;) even looks like Gurren Lagann&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.be/search?q=gurren+lagann+kamina&amp;amp;tbm=isch&quot;&gt;Kamina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the ressemblance is so deep, it sometimes feels like an hommage.
Battles fuelled by fighting spirit, huge mechas that change, battle that
escalate to planetary scale, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;ostensibly&lt;/em&gt; the movie is somewhat closer to Gurren Lagann, it found it
actually closer to Kill la Kill in terms of direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s constant action that almost never lets up, ultra-fast pacing with no
useless downtime. This is a lot like Kill la Kill. Gurren Lagann is a story that
breathes more. Characters have more complex emotions that are given screen time
to be explored more in depth. Relationships are subtler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all this would be complex to render in a movie, and still make a good action
flick. I reviewed the first &lt;a href=&quot;/even-more-anime/#gurren-lagann-the-movie-childhoods-end&quot;&gt;Gurren Lagann movie&lt;/a&gt;, which is an attempt to
condense the TV show to two movies. My conclusion was that it was an abject
failure — you&amp;#39;re rushed through emotional developments in a way that is simply
not satisfying or meaningful enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Promare is free of these shackles, and I found it to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt;
satisfying. It works as a movie version of the genre (in this it is a bit like
the &lt;a href=&quot;#konosuba-legend-of-crimson&quot;&gt;Konosuba! OVA&lt;/a&gt;). This is not to say that the characters don&amp;#39;t have emotions,
but they are less complex and fraught, and can be satisfyingly handled in a bit
less than two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is not totally a re-thread. In particular, it has its own distinctive
visual style, that revolves around geometric shapes. Cubes feature prominently,
for instance ice-cube shooting guns. There are a lot of triangles as well, for a
distinctive low-polygon aesthetic on some effects (e.g. lightning). There is
also a very tasteful use of pastel colors that I personally found delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it is &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; a re-thread. If there is one bad thing to be said about
Promare, it&amp;#39;s that it avoids the risk of proposing something new, which would
really have made it stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve liked Gurren Lagann or Kill la Kill, go watch Promare. If you don&amp;#39;t
know about either, go watch one of those things and figure out if it&amp;#39;s your
style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;lucky-star&quot;&gt;Lucky Star&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky Star was another anime we were slated to binge, but I couldn&amp;#39;t be there on
the first day. I tried to catch up on my own, but two episodes in, it was clear
it wasn&amp;#39;t for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the first episode must be the most boring piece of anime I&amp;#39;ve seen in a
very long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They just talk, about whatever (&amp;quot;how to eat a chocolate scone&amp;quot; is at topic that
takes up a big chunk of the time in that first episode).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second episode is a bit better, at least you get the passage of time for the
semblance of plot (it&amp;#39;s holiday and they have to do homework, and then it&amp;#39;s
school).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slice of life is not my big thing, but I can get into it. I liked &lt;a href=&quot;/more-anime/#k-on&quot;&gt;K-On!&lt;/a&gt; a lot.
But here it&amp;#39;s hard. There&amp;#39;s little sense of direction, absolutely no stakes or
tension. It&amp;#39;s not particularly funny (though I get how it could get one to
smile). I don&amp;#39;t begrudge the art style, but it&amp;#39;s not particularly pretty, and
it&amp;#39;s obviously low-budget. I&amp;#39;m not very observant of these things, but it struck
even me that there were no animated/detailed backgrounds in many scenes. Not
that I matters much, but the animation is not the show redeeming&amp;#39;s quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I kinda get it. In a way totally, utterly &lt;strong&gt;different&lt;/strong&gt; from
Samurai Champloo, I get how people can like this. There&amp;#39;s something about the
humor / aesthetic that&amp;#39;s kinda nice? If only they could manage to interest me at
all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;westworld-season-3&quot;&gt;Westworld Season 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;westworld-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: I won&amp;#39;t spoil the events of the season below, but I will give some
meta-spoiler that will let you know what twists to expect or not. If you don&amp;#39;t
want that, now is the time to exit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;ve not reviewed the first two seaons, let&amp;#39;s recap first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Westworld season 1 is the best thing that&amp;#39;s ever been on TV. Ever. I
think it&amp;#39;s superior to most movies and TV shows. Maybe something like The Lord
of The Rings, The Dark Knight, or the first season of The Wire comes really
close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a delightful story, there are (many) delightful mysteries that you can&amp;#39;t
help but get caught thinking about. The story is compelling, the acting is on
point, the dialogue is incredible. It&amp;#39;s one of the only things I&amp;#39;ve rewatched in
recent years, and it was still supremely enjoyable on second viewing, even
knowing all the twists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah. Season 2 though? Not so good. It has the twists and mysteries, but
sometimes they feel a bit gratuitous, like they thought &amp;quot;Westworld is narrative
twists&amp;quot; and contorted the story to add them. Some of the main characters&amp;#39; arcs
are uninteresting, or downright bad (coughs &lt;em&gt;Shogun World&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s still pretty good though, but a far cry from season 1. Just your &amp;quot;normal
better-than-average TV&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sublime hit, one miss. Season 3 is the time of reckoning. Was season 2 a
fluke?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly it wasn&amp;#39;t. The more I think about season 3, the less I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts strong though, I&amp;#39;d say I was pretty excited until the middle, then I
progressively started feeling, with increased certainty with each passing
episode, that the conclusion would be sub-par.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise is interesting. Aaron Paul&amp;#39;s character is very intriguing. All these
new elements appear and you&amp;#39;re like &amp;quot;hoo, mysteries, twists&amp;quot;. Well except there
is no real twist. Well there is a &amp;quot;twist&amp;quot; towards the middle of the season, but
no narrative-reframing timeline-magic everything-falls-into-place twist like in
the first two seasons. Yet there were signs... inconsistencies, small details in
a show that is known for its attention to details. I&amp;#39;ve seen people on the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/westworld/&quot;&gt;subreddit&lt;/a&gt; complain: have they become sloppy, or are they just messing with us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed where it could have gone, but at the end of the season, there is no
part of it that I liked in its entirety. One of the main character arc is
completely useless, serving only to remind us that the character exists. Mostly
a waste of good screen time. One of the other main character&amp;#39;s motivation are
dumb and tired, a re-thread from previous seasons, and should have been put to
rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet another of the main characters has big plans. But obviously the
showrunners have trouble writing a good (or even, clear) plan for a character
with unlimited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mastermind played by Vincent Cassel was completely milquetoast compared to
Anthony Hopkins&amp;#39; Ford in the first season. The only thing interesting about him
was his biography, but nothing he says is particularly fascinating, the way
Ford&amp;#39;s monologues are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides twists and narratives, the big victim of the season is dialogue. There&amp;#39;s
too little of it, and it&amp;#39;s not good enough. Season 1 had all these philosophical
motifs that it would call often echo in dialogue, even if it wasn&amp;#39;t a deep
philosophical conversation (of which there were some too). Instead we get a lot
of action. Westworld is not so great with action. It&amp;#39;s not incompetent, but it&amp;#39;s
not impressive, and it&amp;#39;s often dumb in season 2 and 3 (a lot of shooting and not
a whole lot of hitting, some pretty heavy plot armors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All around, it felt like a dumbing down of the show. I wonder if this was
voluntary or not. Season 2 did worse than season 1. As it turns out, season 3
did significantly worse than season 2 (but as it is, it&amp;#39;s still HBO&amp;#39;s most
popular show this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s end on a positive note though, the show looks really good. The locations
(often in Singapore) are excellent, and the work on the environment (lighting,
etc) is really nice. Some of the shots (in particular those that frame the
characters agains the background locations) are very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also sounds pretty damn nice. I especially like the choice of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tunefind.com/show/westworld/season-3&quot;&gt;insert songs&lt;/a&gt;,
from &amp;quot;Common People&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Brain Damage&amp;quot;. On the more cinematic side, Ramin
Djawadi is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRWL5oACOrQV_R9cQKGxZBJ3w0lIjJTom&quot;&gt;still rocking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it ain&amp;#39;t great, it&amp;#39;s also not that bad. I&amp;#39;m invested enough that I&amp;#39;ll
probably watch the next season.&lt;/p&gt;
