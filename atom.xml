      <title>GameStop: Anatomy of a Short &amp; Gamma Squeeze</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Part of a series of posts on &lt;a href=&quot;/finance&quot;&gt;finance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of January the stock price of GameStop (GME), a brick-and-mortar
video game retailer, went completely crazy. This has been chronicled in a lot of
details in the press, but I feel like shedding light on a few points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m motivated to do so because (a) I have discussed/explained the events quite a
bit with some friends and colleagues, and (b) the common narratives around the
events are quite misleading, whether they come from the people who think we
witnessed greatness, those who think we witnessed madness, those who think
internet randos stuck it to Wall Street, or those who think Wall Street yet
again took advantage of the little folks. Me? I believe all of the above. It&amp;#39;s
complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the year-to-date chart of the GME stock price (click the picture
for a bigger version):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;gme.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;gme.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to write a summary of the events, you can find that online, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze&quot;&gt;on
wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/02nxI&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (warning for that second link: lots
of unreasonable speculation). If you&amp;#39;re not familiar with the matter, I highly
recommend you give those a read, otherwise the rest of this article won&amp;#39;t make
much sense. You can also try to google around for other takes, to see what the
media coverage was like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here is a short summary of the key points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short-selling is borrowing a share to sell it, hoping to repurchase it later at
a smaller price, hence booking a profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short squeeze occurs when the stock price increases instead, forcing
short-seller to &amp;quot;purchase to cover&amp;quot; at loss, further driving the price up.
Read to understand why they were forced to do so in this case, and how GME
could be shorted at more than 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short-selling make the market more efficient by making prices reflect
material information faster. This is not to say that markets are ultimately
efficient (that much should be obvious), but they would be less efficient
without short-selling. Short-selling also can&amp;#39;t bankrupt a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened: retail investors hyping the stock, notably on the
WallStreetBets reddit board, driving the price up. This triggered a short
squeeze (which was part of the explicit plan of at least some redditors).
This did in turn trigger a gamma squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gamma squeeze is an increase in the stock price driven by market makers
(who sell options) &lt;a href=&quot;/options/#option-greeks&quot;&gt;delta&lt;/a&gt;-hedging their option contracts. This makes them
insensitive to change in the stock price and lets them pocket the option
premium. Having sold call options, the increase in stock price caused them to
purchase more stock to maintain the hedge, further driving the price up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the prevalent narrative, there was a lot of fast, non-retail
money at play in GME while the stock was acting crazy in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;short-selling-mechanics&quot;&gt;Short-Selling Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GME&amp;#39;s incredibly run is often attributed to a &amp;quot;short squeeze&amp;quot;. But what is that
even?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-sellers believe a stock&amp;#39;s price will go down. They act on this believe by
borrowing the stock, selling it, and planning to repurchase it later, at a lower
price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short squeeze occurs when the price of a stock rises sharply, forcing
short-sellers to purchase back the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they believe the stock is worthless and will eventually crash back down, do
they have to cover? Long story short: yes, because of margin requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, unlike purchasing stock, short-selling exposes you to potentially unlimited
losses: there is no limit to how high a stock can go, but it can&amp;#39;t go lower than
0. As the share price increase, you become insolvent on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerage firms do not like their clients to be insolvent, even if &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s only
temporary&amp;quot;. So they impose margin requirements, which dictate how much
collateral you must own to offset the losses incurred by increase in the price
of a stock you sold short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokerage can also require that short sellers return the loaned share &amp;quot;with
minimal notice&amp;quot;. It is my understanding that they do not tend to do this
excepted in extraordinary situations, because they profit from lending the
shares, and doing this abusively would lead to short-sellers to take their
business elsewhere. The GME short-squeeze certainly qualifies as an
extraordinary situation, but I haven&amp;#39;t heard any report that brokers recalled
loaned shares. In general, the margin requirements will fulfill the same purpose
in a more transparent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If short-selling mechanisms are unclear for you, I recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)#Mechanism&quot;&gt;the
&lt;em&gt;Mechanism&lt;/em&gt; section of the wikipedia page on shorting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that&amp;#39;s very unusual and salient in the GameStop story is that GameStop
had a short interest greater than 100%. Said otherwise, &lt;strong&gt;there were more shares
being sold short than actually existing shares&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this possible? It&amp;#39;s quite simple. When you sell a share short, you borrow
it from person A, promising to return it, and sell it to person B. Person B does
not know you&amp;#39;re a short-seller and perceives this as a completely normal
transaction. Person B is entirely free to borrow his share to another
short-seller, who will in turn sell it to person C. This process can
theoretically continue forever. Now, persons A, B and C all own the same share.
Note however that persons A and B, having loaned their shares, do not have the
associated voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-short-sellers-evil&quot;&gt;Are short-sellers evil?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WallStreetBets crowd — and many other people too, including some that should
have known better, sadly — were quick to formulate all kind of spurious
narratives regarding the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those narratives is that short sellers are evil greedy capitalists out to
destroy companies like GameStop. Well, they are probably greedy capitalists —
who on the stock market isn&amp;#39;t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a new idea. Would it surprise you that people blamed short-sellers
for the 1929 stock market crash? Politicians passed restrictions on short
selling at various time that systematically failed to have any impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little bit of common sense should be sufficient to understand this. If
short-sellers drive the price down, they are offering a bargain to those who
believed the prevous price to be fair. The stock is now under-valued and there
is a profit to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-sellers also cannot literally destroy a business. What they can do is
severely impede the company&amp;#39;s ability to finance itself by emitting new shares
(since the value of those is much lower). However, a stock offering is not the
only means to finance a company, and you get the idea that if the company can&amp;#39;t
even secure a loan, the short-seller might have a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, short-sellers fulfill a useful function in the market — they help make
price more accurate. (This is not to say that market prices are generally very
accurate, but they would be even less so without short-sellers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, if a stock is mostly owned by slow-moving &amp;quot;instutional&amp;quot; investors (banks,
pension funds, etc), a negative piece of news (lackluster earnings report,
business problems, ...) might take some time to be reflected in the stock price.
For a stock that used to be up, retail (= normal people) investors would also be
reluctant to sell without seeing that the stock is actually dropping.
Short-sellers provide that impetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the longer term, imagine a &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; company. Its proponents affirm it will be
the next Amazon/Apple/Tesla. Other people believe it be a scam. Without
short-selling, the second group has no bearing on the stock price, which will
only reflect the bull view. But with short-selling, this group now has a
financial incentive to express its opinion in the market. This is particularly
important because while the stock price should ideally be the endpoint of
reflection about a company&amp;#39;s value, the price (and its history) is in practice
also a big data point in the investment decision. Would you rather purchase a
company whose valuation has consistently been high compared to fundamentals, or
one whose valuation has consistently been low? The former is typically (and with
reason) interpreted has a sign of optimism regarding the company&amp;#39;s prospects,
and vice-versa for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, short-selling is quite risky — since the market is skewed to
the upside (thankfully!), and has been particularly so in recent years, given
historically high company valuations, and rampant speculation in growth stocks
(I&amp;#39;m not judging, I did my part).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;short-squeeze-gamma-squeeze&quot;&gt;Short Squeeze? Gamma Squeeze?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GME&amp;#39;s incredibly run is often attributed to a &amp;quot;short squeeze&amp;quot; (the wikipedia
article is even titled &lt;em&gt;GameStop short squeeze&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that picture is incomplete. Retail interest, causing the price to go up, and
the subsequent short squeeze were certainly the initial drivers of the stock&amp;#39;s
stratospheric rise. But it&amp;#39;s not the only thing that sustained its growth to
almost 500$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was at least one other major component to the price action, and that was a
&lt;em&gt;gamma squeeze&lt;/em&gt; (also known as &lt;em&gt;gamma trap&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamma is a second-order stock option greek. If you don&amp;#39;t know anything about
stock options, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;/options&quot;&gt;a primer here&lt;/a&gt;. The primer covers first-order
options greeks, including &lt;em&gt;delta&lt;/em&gt;, but not the second-order &lt;em&gt;gamma&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/options/#option-greeks&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Delta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in brief: if the delta is 0.5, that means if the stock price
increases by 1$, the call option price will increase by 0.5$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So delta is the derivate (in the mathematical sense) of the price of the option
with respect to the price of the underlying stock — just like speed is the
derivative of the distance with respect to the elapsed time: at 10km/h the
travelled distance increases by 10km for every hour travelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gamma&lt;/em&gt; then, is the second derivative of option price with respect to the stock
price. Gamma tell you how much &lt;em&gt;delta&lt;/em&gt; varies when the underlying stock price
increases by 1$ — just like acceleration is the second derivate of the distance
with respect to elapsed time: a 10 km/s^2 acceleration means that your speed
increases by 10 km/s every second!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s a gamma squeeze, then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most options are sold by market makers, which are large institutions such as
investment banks, and they hedge the options they sell by purchasing (or
selling) stock in order to be &amp;quot;delta neutral&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for instance, if they sell a call option at the money (&amp;quot;ATM&amp;quot;, strike price =
current price), the delta is 0.5, and they will also purchase 50 shares of the
underlying to hedge the option. Now if the price increases by 1$, they are up
50$ on the stock, down 50$ on the call, and they can profit by pocketing the
premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because delta changes as the price changes, the market maker needs to manage its
stock position to keep its hedge. As an option gets in the money (strike price &amp;lt;
current stock price), its delta increases, meaning the market maker must
increase the number of stock it purchases to continue being delta-neutral on the
call option it sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the GME case, what what happened is that redditors purchased a lot of cheap
out of the money call options (these have a low delta), and as the stock price
rose and rose, these ended up far in the money, meaning the market makers had to
ultimately purchase many shares for each of these calls, driving the stock price
higher, and pushing all calls farther in the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, why did they purchase out of the money calls? Because they were
cheap, and a rising share price would increase their price too. Slowly at first
(delta is low), but increasingly so as the price increases. If you believe the
price will increase a lot (which people on WallStreetBets obviously did), this
is the best kind of option to be holding (if you believe the price will increase
only moderately, you should hold ATM options instead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s circle back — why is this called a &lt;em&gt;gamma&lt;/em&gt; squeeze? Because it&amp;#39;s caused by
the delta increase in the ATM options, which causes market makers to increase
their purchases to preserve their delta hedge. The rate at which delta increases
as the price rises is given by gamma, the derivative of gamma with regard to
price. (Note that gamma is not itself a constant but a function!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;gamma.svg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much of the squeeze vas due to shorts being squeezed vs gamma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to say, and I don&amp;#39;t know. Obviously the whole thing was started as a
short squeeze, and then gamma amplified the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a ton of capital that piled on once the GME price anomaly caught
everyone&amp;#39;s attention. More on this in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so hard to say? Let&amp;#39;s take the short part of the equation. Large
enough funds have to report positions (including shorts) to the SEC, but such
fillings are only made quarterly. The short ratio for a stock (the percentage of
outstanding shares that have been sold short) is published by the exchange at
the end of each month. The end result is that on any given day, we don&amp;#39;t really
know the short situation in a volatile environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we had daily numbers, we still would be ignorant of the short turnover.
For instance, a constant short ratio might mean that new short sales were made
as prevous short positions were covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the gamma side of things, we have more information, but only slightly. For
each contract, we know the &amp;quot;open interest&amp;quot;, which is the number of open
contracts at the end of the previous day. We also know the number of
transactions involving the contract made so far during the current day. So we
could in theory scrape that data, assume that the counterparty for every call
purchased was a market maker (an approximation which I believe to be close
enough to the truth) and come up with a guesstimate of how much buying resulted
from hedging the positions. There is a lot of imprecision and unknowns there,
and buy volume does not give you, by itself, price impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-retail-frenzy&quot;&gt;A Retail Frenzy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widely reported narrative was that GME was mostly traded by retail traders
(normal people, not institutions). This was certainly true at first. Retail
involvement caused the stock to rise, which in turns caused the short and gamma
squeezes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, once the event made headlines, a lot of people poured in — both retail
and institutional. But institutions (hedge funds, quant shops, etc) have a lot
more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that retail traders didn&amp;#39;t drive all the momentum is easy to see when
you realize that after many brokers, including Robinhood, temporary banned or
severely limited trading on the stock, there was still high volumes of trading
occuring. Interestingly, it seems like retail traders, on aggregate, sold as
much as they bought on the week of 25 Jan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t say more about this, because Matt Levine did so better than I could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop&quot;&gt;in
his Money Stuff column&lt;/a&gt;, including supporting evidence for the points I
make above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;thats-it-folks&quot;&gt;That&amp;#39;s it folks!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, &lt;strike&gt;gamble&lt;/strike&gt; invest responsibly, and don&amp;#39;t believe
everything you&amp;#39;re told. Do your own research!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Favourite Quotes from &quot;Your Music and Your People&quot;</title>
      <description>
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sive.rs/m&quot;&gt;Official Book Homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews&quot;&gt;More Reviews Written by Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/hell-yeah&quot;&gt;My Favourite Quotes from &amp;quot;Hell Yeah, or No&amp;quot; (same author)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got so much enjoyment out of &lt;a href=&quot;/hell-yeah&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hell Yeah Or No&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; that I decided to
read Derek Sivers&amp;#39; other book &amp;quot;Your Music and Your People&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the book isn&amp;#39;t really for me: it&amp;#39;s a treatise on how to market
yourself in the music business. However it&amp;#39;s written in this terse and
delightfully-to-the-point Sivers style. And really, most of the lessons
generalize to any kind of marketing, which we all need from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxing this into &amp;quot;marketing&amp;quot; also doesn&amp;#39;t seem to cut it. Some of the lessons
are much more broadly applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#39;s because I haven&amp;#39;t really thought much about marketing before, but I
excerpted a lot of this one. Just like last time, titles are chapter titles, and
what follows are quotes (mostly) and paraphrases from that chapter. Sometimes
the chapter title is enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;business-is-creative&quot;&gt;Business is creative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But turning off your creativity—trying to play it safe—is the worst thing you
could do. Just like with music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-is-only-a-test-see-what-happens&quot;&gt;This is only a test. See what happens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s actually impossible to fail if your only mission was to see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;restrictions-will-set-you-free&quot;&gt;Restrictions will set you free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-mystery--make-people-wonder&quot;&gt;Make mystery : make people wonder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be so plain or obvious that there’s nothing left to wonder. But don’t be
so cryptic that they give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once people start wondering, they can’t stand not knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;marketing-just-means-being-considerate&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Marketing&amp;quot; just means being considerate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing means listening for what people need, and creating something
surprisingly tailored for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing means getting to know people, making a deeper connection, and keeping
in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;constantly-ask-what-they-really-want&quot;&gt;Constantly ask what they really want&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;touch-as-many-of-their-senses-as-you-can&quot;&gt;Touch as many of their senses as you can&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more senses you touch in someone, the more they’ll remember you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;life-is-like-high-school&quot;&gt;Life is like high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can approach this strategically, as if you were a new kid going to a new
school, with a goal to be popular. It sounds shallow, but it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be who they want to be. In your role as a musician, it’s actually considerate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people want someone to look up to. Someone who’s not of their normal boring
world. Someone who’s being who they wish they could be, if they had the courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-personal&quot;&gt;Get personal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People send business to people they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it starts professional, get personal as soon as possible. Be a friend.
That’s how things are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;always-think-how-you-can-help-someone&quot;&gt;Always think how you can help someone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask them what’s the hardest part about their job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-be-afraid-to-ask-for-favors&quot;&gt;Don’t be afraid to ask for favors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People like doing favors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making them feel important, connected, and needed, you’ll be doing them a
favor, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;small-gifts-go-a-long-way&quot;&gt;Small gifts go a long way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get presents for the people you’ve met that are probably under-appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;persistence-is-polite&quot;&gt;Persistence is polite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the business world, it’s the opposite. If you don’t keep trying, you’re a
loser!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone doesn’t get back to you, it probably wasn’t intentional. Everyone is
busy, and their situation has nothing to do with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work backwards. Just contact someone who’s there, and ask how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old saying, &amp;quot;It’s all who you know,&amp;quot; used to feel so defeating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[after he bought pizza for a hungry music exec visiting school] For the next two
years, he took my calls and gave me all kinds of advice about the music
business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that seems depressing can beﬂipped to work in my favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every deal that’s bad for someone is good for someone else. So instead of
moaning about the bad side, you can take the good side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one interesting phrase to describe your music, you can make total strangers
wonder about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-people-curious-in-one-sentence&quot;&gt;Make people curious in one sentence.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;without-a-good-reason-they-wont-bother&quot;&gt;Without a good reason, they won’t bother&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(checking your music, business, ...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they ask what kind of music you do, they’re actively hoping you’ll give
them a reason to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t give them a reason in that very moment, the opportunity is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-know-how-to-describe-your-music&quot;&gt;Don’t know how to describe your music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask people how they would describe. Look at the description / reviews of other
music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’ve got one you like, try it out on people. See if their face lights up.
See if they get curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-the-tricks-that-worked-on-you&quot;&gt;Use the tricks that worked on you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;proudly-exclude-most-people&quot;&gt;Proudly exclude most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loudly reject 99%. It signals who you are. When someone in your target 1% hears
you proudly excluding the rest, they’ll be drawn to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;well-rounded-doesnt-cut&quot;&gt;Well-rounded doesn’t cut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only problem is, if you’re well-rounded, you can’t cut through anything. You
need to be sharply deﬁned, like a knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the long careers of David Bowie, Miles Davis, Madonna, Prince, Joni
Mitchell, or Paul Simon. Each went through sharply-deﬁned phases, treating each
album as a project with a narrow focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do this every year or two, and you will have a wide variety in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;doing-the-opposite-of-everyone-is-valuable&quot;&gt;Doing the opposite of everyone is valuable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s supply and demand. The more people do something, the less valuable it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone else is multi-tasking. So it’s more valuable to single-task.
Everyone else is hyper-connected. So it’s more valuable to disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to beat them at their game. Play a completely different game. Be
radically opposite. Don’t be associated with them in any way. Be so different
that people don’t even think to compare you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;selling-music-by-solving-a-speciﬁc-need&quot;&gt;Selling music by solving a speciﬁc need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-search-harder-for-the-obscure&quot;&gt;People search harder for the obscure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans of the obscure niches search harder for it. Make sure they canﬁnd you. You
want the passionate fans of your niche, not the casual fans of mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-you-need-a-database&quot;&gt;Why you need a database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(for tracking people)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;stay-in-touch-with-hundreds-of-people&quot;&gt;Stay in touch with hundreds of people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[This chapter include a short description of a system for keeping in touch with people.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are so bad at keeping in touch that they will really appreciate you
doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;meet-three-new-people-every-week&quot;&gt;Meet three new people every week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume your music is great, and you are a likeable person that people
enjoy helping, I’ll make this prediction: The number of people you meet will
determine your success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-in-touch&quot;&gt;Keep in touch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between success and failure can be as simple as keeping in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;every-breakthrough-comes-from-someone-you-know&quot;&gt;Every breakthrough comes from someone you know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take some of that searching time, and spend it on keeping in touch with your
existing contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;put-your-fans-to-work&quot;&gt;Put your fans to work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;include-everyone-in-your-success&quot;&gt;Include everyone in your success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(that helped you get there or treated you well)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-attend-a-conference&quot;&gt;How to attend a conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade contact info within a few minutes of meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send them a message immediately, connecting the digital you to the physical you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the conference, come up with one interesting sentence that says what you
do—including a curious bit that will make them ask a follow-up question. For
example: “Bassist of the Crunchy Frogs—the worst punk bluegrass band ever. We’re
headlining the showcase tonight. Our singer is a pirate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real business is done in the follow-up, not the conference itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best time to get down to business is when they’re alone, back at their
ofﬁce, a week or two after the conference, and can give you their full
one-on-one attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-be-a-mosquito&quot;&gt;Don’t be a mosquito&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn what they love. Learn what they want. Figure out what you can do for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;valuable-to-others-or-only-you&quot;&gt;Valuable to others, or only you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But money only comes from doing something valuable to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on making your music more valuable to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop expecting it to be valuable to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;emphasize-meaning-over-price&quot;&gt;Emphasize meaning over price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It changes the request from a commercial pitch to an emotional connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-people-like-to-pay-let-them&quot;&gt;Some people like to pay. Let them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re offering something for free, don’t forget that there are lots of
people that like to pay! Appeal to this side of people, giving them a reason to
pay that feels good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-higher-the-price-the-more-they-value-it&quot;&gt;The higher the price, the more they value it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s considerate to charge more for your work. People will appreciate it
more, and get better results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-fans-telling-friends-if-not-dont-promote&quot;&gt;Are fans telling friends? If not, don’t promote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-promote-until-people-can-take-action&quot;&gt;Don’t promote until people can take action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;move-to-the-big-city&quot;&gt;Move to the big city&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in the big city, and being where everything is happening, will help your
career the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;detailed-dreams-blind-you-to-new-means&quot;&gt;Detailed dreams blind you to new means&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-you-at-the-starting-line-or-the-ﬁnish-line&quot;&gt;Are you at the starting line or the ﬁnish line?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some artists, releasing their music is like the starting line in a race. The
gun goes off! They work it! They spend hours a day pushing, promoting, and
selling—reaching new people by any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ignore-advice-that-drains-you&quot;&gt;Ignore advice that drains you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;compass-in-your-gut&quot;&gt;Compass in your gut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever excites you, go do it.
Whatever drains you, stop doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing is worth losing your enthusiasm. Nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s almost nothing that you must do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews&quot;&gt;Reviews Series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;overgeared&quot;&gt;Overgeared&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webtoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to chapter 57&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;overgeared.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunch of new webtoons this time around, still in the same &amp;quot;leveling&amp;quot; genre. It&amp;#39;s
crazy that there does not seem to be a name for those, even though they&amp;#39;re all
build around the same mold. It&amp;#39;s crazy to me how they seemingly &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; seem to
feature these floaty alert panels with skills, quests, etc - even when the story
doesn&amp;#39;t not really demand it. Sometimes the protagonist is the only one to see
them. I&amp;#39;m really curious where this all started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I&amp;#39;ll try to be brief as most of these are not really adding saying of
substance. It&amp;#39;s mostly mindless entertainement still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overgeared, then. Basically, this time the protagonist is a craftsman, who
manages to become very powerful (mostly) through his items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protagonist also distinguished itself by not being the most savvy, and often
greedy in a base way. This is generally the setup for some light comedy.
Personally, I didn&amp;#39;t think it works all that well, but it&amp;#39;s not too bothersome
either. A fairly standard entry in the genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;omniscient-readers-viewpoint&quot;&gt;Omniscient Reader&amp;#39;s Viewpoint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webtoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to chapter 36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of this one is quite interesting: the protagonist has been the only
redear of a light novel for years, depicting a sort of apocalypse where
otherwordly entities descend on earth and make humans compete for them
(featuring of course, skills &amp;amp; leveling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our man finishes the light novel, the scenario it describes comes to passes.
He now has a very important advantage: he already knows what will happen. This
includes the rules of this brave new world, but also specific events that will
happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the light novel did have a hero, which is also present in the
story. One cool consequence is that the protagonist must ensure the hero
survives, as the light novel followed the hero, and future events are tied to
him. It&amp;#39;s by no mean the only cool idea in a series that I found a bit smarter
than average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t that many chapters out currently, but I&amp;#39;m curious to see where this
will go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-am-the-sorcerer-king&quot;&gt;I Am The Sorcerer King&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webtoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to chapter 123&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, everybody levels to fight appearing monsters, blah blah blah. This time the
protagonist is a reincarnated sorcerer, from a dimension where people can grow
in power but do not level in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is as pure as a power trip as I&amp;#39;ve ever seeen, featuring a mixing of the
genres, between RPG skills, non-RPG magic, and even science. Suffice to say that
at some point, magical nuclear weapons are being fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-motivation-hacker&quot;&gt;The Motivation Hacker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book, by Nick Winter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this book because it was quoted extensively from &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-9/#gateless&quot;&gt;Gateless&lt;/a&gt;, and those
quotes were some of the most interesting parts of that book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was honestly a bit of a letdown. Not that the book is bad. In fact, I&amp;#39;m glad
I read it, and found it generally interesting and relevant. But it wasn&amp;#39;t what I
had imagined / hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hoped for a book that would outline very precisely a great number of
&amp;quot;motivation hacks&amp;quot; that could be called on. In reality, there are less than I
hoped (12-15 or so) and they aren&amp;#39;t discussed in any great depth. The book is
mostly concerned with how the authors used those in practice — which is
legitimately impressive and inspiring. Those still can be a game changer, but I
had passing familiarity with most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I hoped beyond that was for a more technical angle, in particular with
regards to the psychology of these motivation tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another objection I have is that very clearly the author is someone that was
very accomplished to begin with, before tackling all the challenges in the book.
A great part of what makes those hacks successful, in my opinion, is the
groundwork laid by a consistent productivity habit. This means the techniques
might be less effective than it seems in people who do not have this record of
accomplishment and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, if you cannot immediately name some motivation hacks and you&amp;#39;re in the
mood to get some motivation into you to tackle some important projects, this is
recommended reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-laws-of-human-nature&quot;&gt;The Laws of Human Nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book, by Robert Greene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this, but I do not know if I will finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not the first book by Robert Greene that I read. I&amp;#39;ve read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13589182-mastery&quot;&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1303.The_48_Laws_of_Power&quot;&gt;The 48 Laws of Power&lt;/a&gt;. I started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20995.The_Art_of_Seduction&quot;&gt;The Art of Seduction&lt;/a&gt;, but did
not finish for exactly the same reason as this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greene is a pretty good author in my estimation. He writes well, in an
authoritative style whose old-fashionedness gives him charm. It is well
researched, and the historical examples are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem with Greene is that the books are positionned as advice or education (or
to use a less charitable term, self-help). Personally, I find it hard to get
something very useful out of them besides inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange thing is, Greene is generally correct. And when the ideas he
proposes veer machievellian (in the sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince&quot;&gt;the original&lt;/a&gt;), the
perspectives he proposes need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the ideas offered are rarely thought-provoking (at least I&amp;#39;ve
you are somewhat well-read), and difficult to operationalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about &amp;quot;The Laws of Human Nature&amp;quot; in particular. In it, Greene
examines fundamental human tendencies - how they can betray us, how they can be
exploited (by ourselves or others, for good or for evil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first few chapters, he recommends such things as listening deeply to
others, noticing when body language disagress with spoken language and setting
the tone for your team. All excellent ideas, albeit hardly anything I haven&amp;#39;t
heard before. The problem is that first, nobody would disagree that these are
good ideas, and second - even once you&amp;#39;ve resolved to, for instance, listen
deeply - how do you actually remember to do it in the heat of conversation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the book is entertaining to some extent, albeit massive. But
don&amp;#39;t expect too much in the way of terms of wisdom that you can act on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though, I am compelled to add... I appreciate there is a public for which
Greene&amp;#39;s perspective is foreign, and would be profusely useful. In a sense, I
think too much like the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-age-of-em&quot;&gt;The Age of Em&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book, by Robin Hanson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vision of the future, which purports to be (more) based on scientific theories
than published alternatives. The author acknowledged this is very much only a
tiny possibility for the future, but at least one that does not seem grossly
contradictory with current scientific knowledge, both in the exact and social
sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally - I found myself thoroughly bored at the initial description of that
future. I might have been unfair to the book, as Hanson explicitly warns that he
will first describe the end point, then justify why he thinks this endpoint is
plausible — which is arguably the interesting part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll pick this again. Truth is this was a
moonshot, not something I&amp;#39;m fundamentally interested in. A big reason I gave it
a shot, was that Hanson is famous for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.overcomingbias.com/&quot;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt; and in particular his writing
on biases and signalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have other books that interest me more, but I needed some audiobooks to listen
to while running, and this proved easier to find than some other things on my
list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-economics&quot;&gt;Basic Economics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book, by Thomas Sowell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic Economics proved a tad too basic for me. It&amp;#39;s essentially a watered down
version of the political economy course I got in my first year at uni. It&amp;#39;s well
written, but it&amp;#39;s a bad fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I however very much recommend following &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ThomasSowell&quot;&gt;the twitter account&lt;/a&gt; that
tweets out quips quoted from Thomas Sowell&amp;#39;s books. They&amp;#39;re biting, usually
true, and often about simple ideas that are often misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;great-pretender&quot;&gt;Great Pretender&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seasons 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;great-pretender.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! Here&amp;#39;s an anime that felt different. From the international setting and
bright pastel color palette to the amazing story-telling — there were so much
that was unique about this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows a group of conmen in a series of ambitious cons. Twists abounds! It&amp;#39;s
almost a trick — there are enough twists that it becomes difficult to call any
one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to dither much — just watch this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tomb-raider-king&quot;&gt;Tomb Raider King&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webtoon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to chapter 186&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pitch of this one is that suddenly &amp;quot;tombs&amp;quot; start to appear in the world,
holding sentient relics which can bestow their owner great powers, though the
relics generally try to take advantage of their owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hero is part of a tomb raiding team, gets betrayed, but by the magic of
scenario, gets sent back 15 years in the past, at the start of the relic
phenomenon. There, he can use his knowledge to get ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; he also gain special abilities that he can level. Duh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup leads to inventive situations, exploiting all kind of relics&amp;#39; power.
The story does not try to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; clever or overly consistent, but the
relentless action helps suppress potential suspension of disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference from other webtoon however is that the main character is
kind of a dick. He&amp;#39;s not evil in the sense of murdering people in cold blood,
but he&amp;#39;s not a nice person either, never hesitating to use other people to his
advantage. Story-wise, that&amp;#39;s not particularly good or bad, but it&amp;#39;s different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertaining enough, but doesn&amp;#39;t crack my top list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-untethered-soul&quot;&gt;The Untethered Soul&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book, by Michael Alan Singer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s starting to be a theme, but here is yet another book and started and put
back almost immediately. I had picked up the recommendation from somewhere and
it&amp;#39;s saving grace was that I was able to find an audiobook on it easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a book about mindfulness, but the start of it felt rather very basic, and
offering zero insights to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for books on mindfulness, I&amp;#39;d recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6708.The_Power_of_Now&quot;&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22878980-you-are-here&quot;&gt;You Are Here&lt;/a&gt;. The first one is more &amp;quot;mystical&amp;quot;, but quite interersting, while
the second one is a down to earth guide to more mental calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quotes of the &lt;em&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/em&gt; made it into my &lt;a href=&quot;/unconstraining&quot;&gt;Unconstraining&lt;/a&gt; post from
way back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;beastars&quot;&gt;Beastars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;beastars.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world of anthropomorphized animals, a socially awkward wolf falls in love
with a spunky rabbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animals are ostensibly vegetarian (interestingly - not vegan), but the
carnivores&amp;#39; instincts leads to what can only be described as &amp;quot;frayed race
relationships&amp;quot;. The whole thing is also quite Japanese to boot, including a
hefty dose of what I&amp;#39;d call &amp;quot;societal cynicism&amp;quot; (though they might not see it
the same way, I suppose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this setup speak little to the goodness of the show. And good it is. I&amp;#39;d
say its strength are really unusual and highly interesting characters.
Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought season 2, while still quite good, was a bit weaker. The ending, in
particular, left me super perplexed. I&amp;#39;m not sure why the director believed
going in the chosen direction would make for a good, engaging or satisfying
conclusion to the storyline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;better-call-saul&quot;&gt;Better Call Saul&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;better-call-saul.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better Call Saul is as good as ever. I haven&amp;#39;t written about the show before,
but I&amp;#39;ve been a fan of the first four seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I love about BCS is how, on the surface, not much is happening, but
thanks to the incredible acting, you perceive that the characters are going
through all sorts of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least, it feels like not much is happening. This is not an action show,
but the plot is engrossing, and frankly excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better Call Saul is of course a Breaking Bad&amp;#39;s spinoff. I always felt Better
Call Saul was a notch above. It&amp;#39;s been a while since I saw Breaking Bad, so who
knows. It might also be that Breaking Bad is much more conflicted, in a sense.
You want to root for Walt, but you also dislike him (and the same is true, to a
lesser extent, for Jesse). Better Call Saul, despite having plenty of conflict,
is easier to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this review is not doing justice to the show at all, but trust me, it&amp;#39;s
worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wandavision&quot;&gt;WandaVision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started watching this because so many people were talking about it. I was
hoping it was going something a bit un-marvelish (it&amp;#39;s about Wanda the Scarlet
Witch and Vision the android - MCU characters) - and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj9J2ecsSpo&quot;&gt;trailer&lt;/a&gt;
was intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the end, it wasn&amp;#39;t to be. The trailer essentially gives you the plot
of the first three episodes, which are parodies of old TV shows, with ominous
signs interspersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to find out that quite a few reviewers found these parodies
delightful... I personally found them to be a bit of a drag. If you like old
shows, go watch them directly, it&amp;#39;s bound to be much better — the jokes weren&amp;#39;t
particularly great either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you make it past the first three episodes, the intrigue kicks into
high gear and things get interesting. That being said, what you&amp;#39;re left with is
a typical Marvel experience: entertaining, eminently watchable, but not
particularly profound, fascinating, or delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the show entertains until the end, I think the ending peters out a little
bit. Contrary to one might have hoped, there&amp;#39;s very little mystery being
unveiled (or rather, the mystery is disappointing). Whatever twists there are,
are ... unexpected, but not in a particularly good way. This is no Westworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a must watch, but if you&amp;#39;re bored and like the MCU, then maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;cobra-kai&quot;&gt;Cobra Kai&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;cobra-kai.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobra Kai is absolutely delightful. This 34-years-after sequel of &lt;em&gt;The Karate
Kid&lt;/em&gt; offers to follow Johnny Lawrence — the main antagonist of the movie, and
rival of hero Daniel LaRusso — as he picks back Karate and resumes his rivarly
with Daniel, involving a bunch of local kids along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a cute idea, straigtht from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nrzqc7F-Ans&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/em&gt; episode&lt;/a&gt;
episode. And if you watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCwwxNbtK6Y&quot;&gt;the trailer&lt;/a&gt;, cute and naive and
goofy is what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people, this thing has depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, still, in a sense a very innocent show. Innocent is probably not the
right word, but it has this earnestnest that you don&amp;#39;t see much in TV shows
these days — the stuff the original was made of. There&amp;#39;s good reasons we see
little of it. It&amp;#39;s been done successfully many time before, and if you fail at
earnestness, then the failure always looks all the more ridiculous and
out-of-touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobra Kai wears its earnestness on its sleeve, but, surprisingly does not seek
to subvert it, at least not in the usual way. Instead of sticking to the usual
manichean schema (hero vs villain — whoever that may be), the show is
surprisingly nuanced. Both Johny and Daniel are often wrong-headed hotheads, but
both are essentially good people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual subversion of the classical story is that the (anti-)hero is an
asshole too. Here it&amp;#39;s that everyone is human. That sounds adorkable and a bit
too warm and fuzzy — which makes the show&amp;#39;s ability to pull it out so much more
impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show really runs with that theme, and it extends far wider than just Johnny
and Daniel. One particularly interesting way in which it does this is by
recasting the events of the original movie as essentially traumatic for our two
protagonists. While Daniel &amp;quot;wins&amp;quot; in the movie, he still remember being a
bullied kid. And of course, Mr Miyagi&amp;#39;s (his wise Japanese sensei in the movie)
teachings become the cornerstone of his life philosophy. But Johnny sees Daniel
as up-an-comer who stole his girlfriend and his karate title — an endeavour in
which he had invested his whole personal (and fragile) self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings to maybe the thing that makes me the most uneasy about the show —
it&amp;#39;s reliance on misunderstandings between characters. Because everyone involved
is essentially good, it often feels like if everyone could sit together and say
their piece, most issues would be solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally I hate misunderstanding-driven plots. Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet is hot garbage in
my book. The show walks a tight line regarding misunderstandings. Characters do
sometimes talk things out. Things never spiral out of control on the back of
increasing misunderstandings. But the misunderstandings keep happening,
necessary to carry a conflict that perhaps can&amp;#39;t sustained solely on the basis
of the philosophical disagreements. I must say that so far I&amp;#39;m impressed with
the show&amp;#39;s ability to perform this balancing act. I just hope they can keep it
up for the next three seasons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure you&amp;#39;ll be as impressed by Cobra Kai as I was (though I sure hope
so), but if you enjoyed The Karate Kid, you certainly need to try this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Season 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above was written before watching season 2. I think season 2 holds up
pretty well. It definitely keeps toeing the line with misunderstandings - but
nothing show-ruining. Having actually seen two episodes of the third season
already, I&amp;#39;m very curious as to where this takes two characters that feature
prominently in season 2 — namely Kreese and Tory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by the attempt to also flesh these characters, given them a more
sympathetic side (and early in season 3, more backstory). This is particulary
true for Kreese, which the shows sets up as a clear-cut antagonist, playing
ominous music every occasion it gets. It&amp;#39;s interesting and certainly not what
you expect. Though I must say compared to something like Game of Thrones, where
you actually get to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; the inner thought process of &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; characters, it can
sometimes feel a bit weird. Curious to see what season 3 does with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mushoku-tensei-jobless-reincarnation&quot;&gt;Mushoku Tensei (Jobless Reincarnation)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;mushoku-tensei.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easily one of my favourite anime of the winter season (a tie with Attack on
Titans, probably). It&amp;#39;s not exactly surprising, it&amp;#39;s about a loser who dies and
gets revived in a fantasy world as a fully-intelligent toddler. That just sound
like all these webtoon I keep reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides plot affinity, the thing is extremely well done. It looks georgeous.
It&amp;#39;s too short (only 11 episodes, though a second season should come later this
year), but the pacing is tight. The show doesn&amp;#39;t repeat itself, nor does it
longer too long in one place. Character development is had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gigguk published excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDh5Us8rl80&quot;&gt;video praise&lt;/a&gt; for the anime, which I wholeheartedly
agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly, one of the better isekai in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rezero&quot;&gt;Re:Zero&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 2, pt. 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/even-more-anime/#rezero&quot;&gt;S1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-8/#rezero-season-2-part-1&quot;&gt;S1, pt. 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my review of &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-8/#rezero-season-2-part-1&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I said I was unsure what to make of this
season, that it would entirely depend on how part 2 delivers on the setup from
part 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well folks, I&amp;#39;m disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like I feared, cutting in the middle with the balls hanging in the air was
a terrible idea. I couldn&amp;#39;t understand what was going on for the first few
episodes, and absolutely no summary (explicit or implicit) was offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was made worse by the fact that the plot is needlessly convoluted. My major
beef is with the characters&amp;#39; motivations. Despite all the revelations, I still
have no idea what Roswal wants or stands for. It&amp;#39;s not even a mystery that works
well — there are multiple conversations where this could (should, really) come
out, but somehow Subaru never asks the right questions. He doesn&amp;#39;t even seem to
think he&amp;#39;s missing anything. Beatrice&amp;#39;s motivation is paper-thin and frankly
dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author&amp;#39;s brain just seem wired to another dimension (like all adaptations,
the question remains whether the fault lies with the original or the
adaptation). A few times I realized that something I had taken to be some
harmless exposition was actually an important piece of context — and you were
apparently supposed to get it. Again, this is made worse by the fact that the
show makes no effort whatsoever to help you make sense of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this point it feels lazy, almost sleazy. The mystery feels artificial,
added on just for effect, not as something that makes sense within the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to this a bunch of completely nonsensical (and frankly boring) speeches, and
the result quite tepid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some good part to the story though. Emilia finally gets some character
development. The ending does feel satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;log-horizon&quot;&gt;Log Horizon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#log-horizon&quot;&gt;S1 &amp;amp; S2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not even disappointed, I&amp;#39;m devastated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve told many people that Log Horizon is one of my favourite anime. I evend
said in my review: &amp;quot;The only bad thing about Log Horizon is that it is
unfinished.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I jinxed it, because this third season is absolutely terrible and devoid of
the charm of the previous instalments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, the show commits the gravest sin of violating &amp;quot;show, don&amp;#39;t tell&amp;quot;. We are
being told stuff con-stant-ly. We are being told how characters feels. How
decisions will impact them. There is absolutely no good reason to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arcs are pretty boring too. It feels like there&amp;#39;s very little at stake. The
pacing is completely unbalanced: the first 5 episodes or so are characters
talking and thinking without any action whatsoever. There is no overarching
theme to the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game mechanics still feature, but in a pretty uninimaginative way, and without
the accompanying broad consequences on the world that made the first two seasons
so interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to be fair, Sasha watched the first two seasons recently and claims that
season 2 is much more like this than I remember. I do remember a couple
excellent episodes, but it&amp;#39;s been like 6 years at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime&quot;&gt;That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/even-more-anime/#that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime&quot;&gt;S1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slime is just being slime: a zero-calories snack, entertaining but not
particularly impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sense that&amp;#39;s too bad. You just know Rimuru the slime can&amp;#39;t lose, and that
does undercut the show&amp;#39;s attempt at drama. Frankly, I would have loved for the
show to go dark all of a sudden, but it was not the be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Mild &lt;b&gt;spoiler&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/summary&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show does in fact get &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot;, but not in tone. Mass-murder is just done
matter-of-factly, but the show is still on the same trajectory: the rise of the
ever-growing, ever-more-powerful alliance of Rimuru&amp;#39;s band of nice monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-promised-neverland&quot;&gt;The Promised Neverland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/even-more-anime/#the-promised-neverland&quot;&gt;S1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Season 2 cuts on the three-level deep plots, and adds some action/adventure. It
was generally solid, ... but something felt missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was because this is only 11 episodes long. Even though the episodes are
well-done, you can&amp;#39;t help but feel rushed. I&amp;#39;m not incredibly satisfied with
this explanation — we should not seek length for length&amp;#39;s sake. But I&amp;#39;m not
entirely sure what they should have done to add weight and emotional impact to
the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends had told me that the show cut some arcs form the story, but
apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://comicbook.com/anime/news/the-promised-neverland-season-2-bad-anime-credit/&quot;&gt;the issues run deeper&lt;/a&gt; and, at the very least, the
show&amp;#39;s screenwriters seem unsatisfied with the show&amp;#39;s direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dr-stone-stone-wars&quot;&gt;Dr Stone: Stone Wars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-5/#dr-stone&quot;&gt;S1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue to very much like Dr Stone. The second season is a continuation of
the story of the first season, and the themes and vibes are similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand by what I said in &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-5/#dr-stone&quot;&gt;my season 1 review&lt;/a&gt;, so you can
go read that if you&amp;#39;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;attack-on-titans&quot;&gt;Attack on Titans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Season 4, part 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#attack-on-titan&quot;&gt;S1&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;/more-anime/#attack-on-titan-season-2&quot;&gt;S2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/even-more-anime/#attack-on-titans-season-3-part-1&quot;&gt;S3
pt. 1&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-4/#attack-on-titans-season-3-part-2&quot;&gt;S3 pt. 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;attack-on-titans.webp&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Season 3 felt like a lull, but season 4 delivers an electroshock. Holy shit! I
didn&amp;#39;t expect this final season to be one of the best of the winter season, but
it was, and easily at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is tight, and engrossing from the start. Things feel fresh, due in
part to a multi-years time skip, and the decision to center the first few
episodes on the introduction of completely new characters that have an important
role to play in this final season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Attack on Titans at its best, not only are the action scenes as good as
ever (although perhaps there will be too little of them for some people), but
the season tells an interesting story in its own right, and the final pieces of
the puzzle finally fall into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a master class in how to do character&amp;#39;s motivations and mystery right.
Take that, Re:Zero!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I&amp;#39;m glad that Attack on Titans probably won&amp;#39;t end up in the &amp;quot;Game of
Throne bucket&amp;quot; of good shows that are hard to recommend because of their shitty
ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you&amp;#39;ve got to admire the gall of the studio, who only let out that this
was &lt;em&gt;part 1&lt;/em&gt; of &amp;quot;Attack on Titans: &lt;strong&gt;The Final Season&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; after the last episode
was released. (At that point, most people&amp;#39;s money was on there being a movie that
would wrap up the story.) What a troll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-wow-diary&quot;&gt;The WoW Diary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book by John Staats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no secret that World of Warcraft is close to my heart. I sank countless
hours in it as a teenager, and I even dabbled in private servers programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, The WoW Diary is an invaluable (and in fact, one of the only) source of
information on how the game was actually made, written by someone who worked on
it. John Staats designed and build the looks of most of the dungeons in the
original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure a review makes much sense, but I thought the book was great, given
my interest in the topic. I&amp;#39;m not sure someone who doesn&amp;#39;t really care about how
games are made would find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here a few things I learned from reading the book that also surprised me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Blizzard&amp;#39;s fame as one of the top video game studios, and one comitted
to quality at that, the working conditions seemed terrible. The team was
crunching on and off for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. The salary is said to be only competitive
after bonuses, of which there were little while the game was still in
development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flip side is how familial the structure felt small and familial, and
internal mobility was not only possible but common. Many if not most of the
slots that opened in the team were filled directly from the &lt;abbr
title=&quot;Quality Assurance&quot;&gt;QA&lt;/abbr&gt; department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had in mind that the team that made the game was relatively small, but in
fact it did number some 80-90 people towards the end of development, among
which at least half were developers. There was also a sizeable number of 3D
artists, texture artists, item designers, quest designers, etc. I wonder if
the same work could be done by fewer people today or if it still would require
around the same number of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team did not use version control until the tail end of development! Long
periods of &amp;quot;broken build&amp;quot; is a common refrain in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The labor of some of the non-developers workforce looked to me like it was
excruciatingly manual and repetitive. There were some pretty impressive
in-house tools, but getting new features in those was apparently a struggle.
To me, hiring four &amp;quot;helping hands&amp;quot; instead of a new tool developer seems like
an obvious oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;casablanca&quot;&gt;Casablanca&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is rated by some as the best movie of all times. I&amp;#39;m not sure it&amp;#39;s all
that, but the movie&amp;#39;s reputation is well deserved - it has aged remarkably
gracefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of listening to me talk about it, go watch this video on Humphrey Bogart
— it&amp;#39;ll make you want to watch some of his movies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running Myself Ragged</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;The past few months have been some of the hardest in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not saying too much — I&amp;#39;ve had, by and large, a very happy life. But as
far as I ever came close to something maybe remotely resembling burn out, that
time is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was due to a combination of factors. Mostly it was the added workload of
&lt;a href=&quot;/compilers&quot;&gt;teaching a class&lt;/a&gt; on top of main job (and doing it in my own effort-intensive
way), and picking up a hobby of very (and not entirely intentionally) &lt;a href=&quot;/heat&quot;&gt;stressful
trading&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, for all the unpleasantness, I think there is a silver lining too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, it feels like my work capacity has permanently increased. I feel much
more confident in my ability to stay on track and consistently work towards a
long-term project. In particular, I think I might now be able to move faster by
being able to spend more time on a project per time unit (day/week/...) than I
did previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned a lot. About finance, teaching, and compilers even. I got to
improve &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/autumn&quot;&gt;existing software projects&lt;/a&gt; and even create new ones (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/uranium&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/sigh&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These benefits did come at the cost of running too close to the red line, for
too long. I think a &lt;a href=&quot;/training&quot;&gt;lifting&lt;/a&gt; metaphor is in order. If you want to get stronger
or bigger, you need to train hard. But if you push yourself &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; hard or for
too long, you indulge in &lt;em&gt;overtraining&lt;/em&gt;, which is detrimental to your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So another lessons from all this is that I might push myself hard in the future,
but I&amp;#39;ll avoid to making it quite this intense. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack&quot;&gt;Only with slack can one be a
righteous dude.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the situation had me do a lot of hard thinking about where I was at,
and where I wanted to go. &amp;quot;Never waste a good crisis&amp;quot;, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, when you&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;working&amp;quot; all the time and most of the respite goes out the
window, you&amp;#39;re really forced to consider whether you actually like what you&amp;#39;re
doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, some of what I did (in which I include my job, teaching, and trading) I
liked, and some I liked less. I&amp;#39;m planning to make changes. But first, maybe
I&amp;#39;ll take a breather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS&lt;/strong&gt;: I hesitated to write this post. The reason is that, while I write for myself
first, I like to write things that are useful for other people, even if the
style is a bit rough. This is mostly about my state of mind, there are not too
many details (on purpose), and I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure the lessons transpose that
easily to other people in other situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this blog acts as a public record of what&amp;#39;s going on with me, and this
felt momentous enough that it deserved a mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I&amp;#39;ve read similar things form other people in the past. Not only do I
remember them, but they have helped shape how I think about such things (in
particular, Sebastian Marshall&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;/celerity/#06-pace-maximum-vs-maximum-sustainable-speed&quot;&gt;writings on Celerity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://podbay.fm/p/the-ultraworking-podcast/e/1571375400&quot;&gt;his
personal account on pushing himself too far&lt;/a&gt;). So maybe it&amp;#39;s not that
useless.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stock Market Adventures: Heat</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Part of a series on &lt;a href=&quot;/finance&quot;&gt;Finance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/options&quot;&gt;Stock Market Adventures: Options &amp;amp; The Wheel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/options&quot;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;, I presented the wheel option strategy (and gave a whole
bunch of background on options).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also said that personally, I was mostly selling puts on growth stocks, using a
wide margin of safety afforded by their high implied volatility. (You do not
know what any of these words mean? Go read &lt;a href=&quot;/options&quot;&gt;the last article&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This did not work out too well. Or rather, it worked fantastically well, but I
failed to execute a proper pivot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry, I&amp;#39;m not ruined. In fact, I haven&amp;#39;t even lost money compared to when
I started trading with this strategy — a whopping 4 months ago. But I am also
not up much, while I was up 30% at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened? The market was bullish on growth, and the strategy was making
bank. Then, at then end of February, there was unrest in the bond market, and
that spilled over to the stock market. This hit tech stocks the hardest, with
the Nasdaq 100 shedding more than 10% from its high, back to where it was last
December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did hit growth stocks even harder. (&lt;em&gt;Growth stock&lt;/em&gt; nice euphemism generally
used for the stock of companies that do not yet make money and/or is very
overvalued — speculative stocks, really). Not everything was affected — many
people talked of &amp;quot;a rotation into value&amp;quot; (where a &lt;em&gt;value stock&lt;/em&gt; is essentially
the opposite of a growth stock).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My puts quickly dropped in value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I messed up. I should simply have taken my losses and liquidated
my positions. Why? Things were outside expected parameters. They were dropping,
but I did not understand why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have two new rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exit out of your positions when your assumptions are violated in a way that
puts your capital in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not understand what is happening and you&amp;#39;re losing money, close your
positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&amp;#39;s better to try to understand what is happening. I did, and I now
know much more about the bond market than previously (expect an article on that
topic soon). But I still did not really understand (or maybe believe) the causal
link between the bond market and the stock market. I thought &amp;quot;certainly, it
can&amp;#39;t be that people are panicking over bond yields raising to a measly 1.5%
(way below March 2020&amp;#39;s already low 2.5%)&amp;quot;. But apparently, it is possible — and
of course selling begets more selling through &lt;em&gt;deleveraging&lt;/em&gt;: as losses mount,
those who trade on margin are forced to liquidate assets to maintain their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(finance)&quot;&gt;margin ratio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead, I thought this was a temporary spike down (albeit a particularly
virulent one), as there had been a few, and the market would pick up again.
#buythedip was trending on Twitter, so I wasn&amp;#39;t the only clueless person out
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t a temporary spike down, and so that&amp;#39;s that. Add to that a dumb (but
totally unrelated) trading mistake I made, and I&amp;#39;m back at square one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole adventure reminded me of the titular sequence from the (awesome)
movie &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot;
src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rGPWW9Pjzto&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video
player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write;
encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil McCauley: A guy told me one time, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t let yourself get attached to
anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the
heat around the corner.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Hanna : What are you, a monk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil McCauley : I have a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Hanna : What do you tell her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil McCauley : I tell her I&amp;#39;m a salesman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Hanna : So then, if you spot me coming around that corner... you just
gonna walk out on this woman? Not say good bye?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil McCauley : That&amp;#39;s the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat came around the corner, and I did not walk out. That was as much part
of the strategy as everything else, but I realized it only too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not all that bad. I &amp;quot;lost money&amp;quot;, but also I didn&amp;#39;t lose anything I didn&amp;#39;t
gain in the market. And I learned a ton. How often do you get paid to learn? The
only thing I regret is that it did bring a lot of stress into my life at a time
where I could have done without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s next? Interesting times for sure. With the market uncertain for growth
stocks, the previous strategy is out of the question. I will probably retreat to
running a wheel-like scheme on safer stocks. Time to put the theory to the test
and see if I&amp;#39;m abel to beat the index. This should also be a bit easier on my
blood pressure. And I&amp;#39;ll keep learning and experimenting. Maybe some other
system will prove superior in the current market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cardio Training</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;This post is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;/training/&quot;&gt;Training Series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-8/&quot;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;, the gyms had just closed again and I was looking at bodyweight
movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up training my handstand for a few weeks (complemented by a rather usual
set of home exercises - see &lt;a href=&quot;/training/&quot;&gt;previous posts&lt;/a&gt; for flavour), but
I&amp;#39;m ashamed to report that while I improved, I&amp;#39;m still incapable of a
free-standing handstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I failed to appreciate is how much strength a handstand actually
requires, and so ramping up was no luxury. In the end, my real Achilles&amp;#39; heel is
balance however. But practice makes perfect, and I expect I&amp;#39;ll revisit this
sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the heels of this, I decided to work on my cardio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people think that weight lifting (particularly the heavy kind) and cardio
sit on opposit ends of the exercise continuum, but I think this is far from the
truth. Weight lifting does actually engage your aerobic (aero = air) system
quite a bit. Try squatting your maximum weight, then see how winded you get!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, it is true that weight lifting tends to be a more intense kind
of effort (more akin to sprinting) rather than steady over a long period of
time. (Note that &lt;em&gt;cardio&lt;/em&gt; does not imply long session, that&amp;#39;s more specifically
&lt;em&gt;steady-state cardio&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently read &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-9/#tactical-barbell&quot;&gt;Tactical Barbell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/reviews-9/#tactical-barbell-2-conditioning&quot;&gt;Tactical Barbell 2:
Conditioning&lt;/a&gt; (links are to my short reviews of them). The first didn&amp;#39;t
teach me much, but the second was intriguing, and so I decided to follow its
&amp;quot;base-building&amp;quot; 8-weeks program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-program&quot;&gt;The Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program is relatively simple. For the 5 first week, you&amp;#39;ll do &lt;em&gt;strength
endurance&lt;/em&gt; circuits on Monday and Thursday, and &lt;em&gt;endurance&lt;/em&gt; training (i.e.
steady-state cardio) on Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of work is designed to increase progressively. The weekly suggested
endurance session duration is 30/40/50/60/45-60 minutes (for week 1 to 5,
respectively). For strength endurance, the program has you do 3 circuits on
Monday and 2 on Thursday (excepted on the fourth week, where you&amp;#39;ll do a single
one each day), with 20/30/40/50/50 repetitions per exercise for each circuit
(from week 1 to 5, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saturday endurance session is bracketed by two recovery days and is meant to
push yourself. The goal is last longer than you did during the week, but not to
exceed two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the thre last week, you&amp;#39;ll do &lt;em&gt;max strength&lt;/em&gt; training (roughly classical
strength training) on Monday and Thursday, and HIC (High Intensity Circuits) on
Tuesday and Friday). Saturday is for &lt;em&gt;endurance&lt;/em&gt;, but not longer than one hour.
Wednesday and Sunday are for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;exercise-selection&quot;&gt;Exercise Selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My prime pick for endurance training was running. The book proposes many
alternatives, but most of them still involve running (sometimes interspersed
with bouts of exercises, or modified, such as running while carrying weight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also indoors alternative, but those typically require access to a gym.
We inherited my sister&amp;#39;s elleptical bike at home, and so I did use that a couple
time. It didn&amp;#39;t feel quite right - in fact, it was too easy. I never really got
winded, and making it hard means increasing the resistances which makes your
ass-cheeks work more than your heart. In the end, something that did work
decently well was continuous running while stopping every 6 minutes to do a
couple of burpees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time though, I did vanilla running. I own a pair of running shoes
(that have relatively little use over the years), and I thought I might as well
focus on the basics. At first, and quite to my surprise, cardio wasn&amp;#39;t a
limiting factor at all. Instead, I developed mild muscular pain as I was
running, mostly at the front of my shin (the tibialis anterior?) and, to a lower
extent, on the inner side of the tight, right above the kneecap (the vastus
medialis, or &amp;quot;teardrop&amp;quot; muscle). It did take two weeks, but the pain did go
away. Maybe the consequences of spending the whole year mostly at home and
walking a whole lot less?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running still wasn&amp;#39;t that easy though. At the end, I was running for about 75
minutes over a bit less than 10km, for a 7:45 min/km average pace. That&amp;#39;s
nothing to brag about. The average male time for running a marathon is 4 hrs 13
minutes — which is faster than my pace for more than 4 times the distance. I&amp;#39;m
probably lugging around more mass than most marathon runners, but I still have a
ways to go. It was also very hard not to walk for a few minutes of the whole
duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;strength-endurance&lt;/em&gt;, the book suggests picking any full-body routine that
can be done for high amount of reps. I picked something dumbell-based, doing
romanian deadlifts, squats, floor presses, overhead presses, trap shrugs and
rows. I used 10kg barbells. Not all of those were equally easy. Doing 50 floor
presses was easy enough for me (especially given the ramp-up in the number of
sets), but for overhead presses, I had to take two short breaks in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For max strength, I went fairly classic. See &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-6&quot;&gt;my July post&lt;/a&gt; if you need some exercise
ideas, but I did actually include less variety than back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I introduced was the single-arm pushed. I&amp;#39;m quite proud to finally
have gotten the hang of it. Doing handstand practice and archer pushups in the
recent past must have helped build for the foundation. Then what was needed was
for the form to click: I start like a diamond pushup, but with legs spread far
apart, then I move one arm to be straight along my body, hand grabbing the leg
on the same side. You also have to, on some level, understand you can do it: you
can&amp;#39;t half-ass push through a one-arm pushup. If you don&amp;#39;t manage, using fingers
from the non-working arms as support is a nice hack — you can progressively
remove fingers until you don&amp;#39;t need that arm anymore. Once it clicked, it wasn&amp;#39;t
that hard, and I can do 10 reps without too much difficulty now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise is tiring though, and I probably made a mistake to run the same
session twice a week. One-handed pushups + bulgarian split squats twice a week
had me really beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the HIC (High Intensity Circuit) session, I shopped around a little bit, but
ended up mostly rope skipping. The first mode was simply rope skipping with
maximal effort for about two minutes, with long breaks (3+ minutes) in between,
6 times. A variant was to rope skip (or run on the elliptical, though that is
much easier), and alternate with dumbell swings and dumbell snatches (those were
suppose to be done with kettlebells, but dumbbells is all I had).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rope skipping (and I suppose, all the running that preceded it) did wonder for
my calves. I think calf raises are dead to me now, it&amp;#39;s all about skipping,
baby!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, the bad thing about rope skipping is that the shocks are not
optimal for muscle hypertrophy. However, they can reinforce the bones, which has
a lot of cross-talk with the muscle. So theretically, a regiment of rope
skipping can ultimately benefit leg hypertrophy, if you can accept to take easy
on your squat for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;next&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s next? I yearn for the gym to reopen, but in the meantime I&amp;#39;m programming
something that looks like a &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-7&quot;&gt;DUP&lt;/a&gt; at home. It&amp;#39;s more difficult to vary intensity
for the same exercise at home, so I&amp;#39;m mostly varying the exercises. Here&amp;#39;s a
copy of the listing of what I&amp;#39;ve planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-org&quot;&gt;* One
** Bulgarian Split Squats, 20kg
** Regular Pushups
** Single Leg Deadlift
** Dumbell Overhead Press, 20kg
** Hollow Man Crunches
** Twisting Situps

* Two
** Romanian Deadlift, 20kg
** Pike Pushups
** Pistol Squats
** Floor Press, 20kg
** Black Widow Knee Slide
** Butterfly Situps

* Three
** Single Arm Pushup
** Barbell Swings
** TXR Face Pulls
** Bodyweight Squats
** W Ab Raises
** Threading The Needle

* Four
** Pullups (spread accross the session)
** Biceps Curl / Standing Triceps Extension
** Lying Leg Curls / Reverse Hypers
** Seated Corkscrew
** Leviation Crunches
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing one exercise of each of four types every session: squat-like,
deadlift-like, arms and shoulders. I finish every session with two small ab
exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heavy squat move is the bulgarian split squat, the heavy deadlift is the
romanian (it&amp;#39;s not really heavy, but I don&amp;#39;t have a better idea — maybe when I
load the one leg version?), the heavy arms exercise is the one-arm pushup, and
the heavy shoulder exercise is the pullup (though the pike is no joke!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to run this for a block until performance starts to degrade or plateau
significantly, so probably around 8 weeks (at which point I&amp;#39;ll also accept a
small pleateau as a reason to stop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For after that, I&amp;#39;m thinking of re-working the handstand in the mix. Maybe some
other bodyweight exercises too?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Favourite Quotes from &quot;Hell Yeah Or No&quot;</title>
      <description>
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sive.rs/n&quot;&gt;Official Book Homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/reviews&quot;&gt;More Reviews Written by Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Sivers&amp;#39; writing style is incredibly terse and pithy. And frankly, it&amp;#39;s a
pleasure to read. The book is very short, and I would recommend you read it in
full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still here is my favourites quotes. Titles are chapter titles, and what follows
are quotes (mostly) and paraphrases from that chapter. Sometimes the chapter
title is enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-if-you-didnt-need-money-or-attention&quot;&gt;What if you didn’t need money or attention?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-you-doing&quot;&gt;Why are you doing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t diffuse your energy, trying to do a little bit of everything, or
you’ll always be in conﬂict with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;imitate-we-are-imperfect-mirrors&quot;&gt;Imitate. We are imperfect mirrors.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your imitation will turn out much different from the original. Maybe even
better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;small-actions-change-your-self-identity&quot;&gt;Small actions change your self-identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;if-youre-not-feeling-hell-yeah-then-say-no&quot;&gt;If you’re not feeling “hell yeah!” then say no&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;im-a-very-slow-thinker&quot;&gt;I’m a very slow thinker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People say that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your
first reaction is usually outdated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can say, &amp;quot;I don’t know,&amp;quot; and take your time to answer after thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-will-this-game-end&quot;&gt;How will this game end?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start something, think of the ways it could end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the smart choice is to say no to the whole game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;relax-for-the-same-result&quot;&gt;Relax for the same result&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So apparently all of that exhausting, red-faced, full-on push-push-push I had
been doing had given me only a 4 percent boost. I could just take it easy and
get 96 percent of the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] Then I notice that I’m all stressed out about something or driving myself
to exhaustion, I remember that bike ride and try dialing back my effort by 50
percent. It’s been amazing how often everything gets done just as well and just
as fast, with what feels like half the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;disconnect&quot;&gt;Disconnect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best, happiest, and most creatively productive times in my life have
something in common: being disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence is a great canvas for your thoughts. That vacuum helps turn all of your
inputs into output. That lack of interruption helps you ﬂow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often ask me what they can do to be more successful. I say disconnect.
Even if just for a few hours. Unplug. Turn off your phone and Wi-Fi. Focus.
Write. Practice. Create. That’s what’s rare and valuable these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get no competitive edge from consuming the same stuff everyone else is
consuming. It’s rare, now, to focus. And it gives such better rewards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;think-like-a-bronze-medalist-not-silver&quot;&gt;Think like a bronze medalist, not silver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of comparing up to the next higher situation, compare down to the
next-lower one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-assume-im-below-average&quot;&gt;I assume I’m below average&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assume you’re below average is to admit you’re still learning. You focus on
what you need to improve, not your past accomplishments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;obvious-to-you-amazing-to-others&quot;&gt;Obvious to you. Amazing to others.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody’s ideas seem obvious to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;subtract&quot;&gt;Subtract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to think I need something else. It’s hard to look instead at what to
remove. Most of us have too much baggage, too many commitments, and too many
priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;seeking-inspiration&quot;&gt;Seeking inspiration?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “inspiration” usually means “something that mentally stimulates you.”
But “inspiration” also means to breathe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meanings poetically combine when you think of yourself breathing in
thoughts, filling your body with ideas. But don’t forget to breathe out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;possible-futures&quot;&gt;Possible Futures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got seventy-two different futures in there as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few times a year, I read through them all. Some seem stupid now, but some get
more and more enticing with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I ﬁnish a big project and I’m feeling ready for a new future, I open this
folder and pick one to make real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;whatever-scares-you-go-do-it&quot;&gt;Whatever scares you, go do it.&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Stock Market Adventures: Options &amp; The Wheel</title>

&lt;p&gt;Part of a series on &lt;a href=&quot;/finance&quot;&gt;Finance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/stock-market-intro/&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said last time I mostly trade using options. In this article I will explain my
main strategy, known as &lt;em&gt;the wheel&lt;/em&gt;. But first, I&amp;#39;ll have to give you a bit of
backgrounds on options. I&amp;#39;ll finish by a more technical explanation of option
pricing and linking to a few other intersting option strategies - in case you&amp;#39;re
interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a long post, with a lot of words (and a few numbers). If
you&amp;#39;d rather watch videos instead, I strongly recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI2eVMd1wtdGwFXMFya1jHpWLvWw6a07X&quot;&gt;Growing Wealth&amp;#39;s
Options Trading Course&lt;/a&gt;. It will teach you option fundamentals, the
wheel strategy, and a few others beside. Also no one says you can&amp;#39;t read the
post &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; watch the videos ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;option-basics&quot;&gt;Option Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;call option&lt;/em&gt; is a contract that allows (but does not force) you to buy 100
shares of a stock at a pre-determined price (the &lt;em&gt;strike price&lt;/em&gt;) until some
point in the future (the &lt;em&gt;expiration date&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, a &lt;em&gt;put option&lt;/em&gt; allows you to sell 100 shares at a pre-determined
strike price until the expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually buying or selling is called &amp;quot;exercising&amp;quot; the option. Options can be
American-style — exercisable at any time until expiration, or European-style —
exercisable only at expiration. In practice this does not make much of a
difference because, excepted in two specific cases, it is always more profitable
to sell an option than to exercise it before the expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Exceptions explained. Feel free to skip!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first exception are that when the stock is going to pay a dividend, the
holder of an option may wish to exercise the option to benefit from the
dividend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second exception is when the option is not very liquid, meaning there is no
one interested in buying it at a greater price than the profit you would make by
exercising the option. This should be extremely rare, as I expect these market
inefficiencies to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp&quot;&gt;arbitraged&lt;/a&gt; away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options must be purchased for a price which is called &lt;em&gt;the premium&lt;/em&gt;. This
premium is usually lower than the stock price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a simple scenario, if you buy a call option and hold it until expiration, you
will profit if the price of the stock ends up being superior to the sum of the
strike price and the premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;call_profit_or_loss = stock_price - (strike_price + premium_paid)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For put options, the logic is reversed, you profit if the stock price goes down
enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;put_profit_or_loss = strike_price - (stock_price + premium_paid)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to understand these formulas. The key idea for a call option is that it
allows you to purchase the stock at the strike price. If the current stock price
is above the strike price, you can buy the stock (through the call option) and
sell it for an instant markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a put option, you can sell stock at the strike price. If the stock price is
under the strike price, you can buy the stock and sell it (through the put
option) for an instant markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who do you buy these options from? Well, anyone really. Anyone that can buy
options can also sell options. An option is a contracts formed between two
parties, one that &amp;quot;buys&amp;quot; the option, and one that &amp;quot;sells&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;writes&amp;quot;) it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person selling the option is making a different bet than the buyer. She is
betting that the stock price will not be high enough for a call option to be
profitable, or that the stock price will not be low enough for a put option to
be profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that turns out true, the option is said to expire worthless. The buyer does
not execute the option (as that would be a money-losing move) and so lost the
premium he paid in the trade. The seller, on the other hand, profits by
pocketing the premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options are characterized by the triplet [underlying stock, strike price,
expiration date], so there a lot of possible combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three useful abbreviations are used to talk about strike prices: an option can
be &lt;em&gt;at the money&lt;/em&gt; (ATM) when the strike price is more or less equal to the
current stock price, &lt;em&gt;out of the money&lt;/em&gt; (OTM) when the strike price is
over/under (call/put) the stock price, and &lt;em&gt;in the money&lt;/em&gt; (ITM) when the strike
price is under/over (call/put) the stock price. When an option expires ITM, you
profit, if it expires OTM, you made a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that OTM options are not worthless (before expiring) — they represent the
potential for the stock price to move in desired direction until the expiration
date. It&amp;#39;s even possible to make money by trading OTM options that have never
been ITM: it suffices to buy an OTM option, and sell it when the stock price has
moved in the right direction (up for call, down for put) - so when the option is
&amp;quot;less OTM&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-use-options&quot;&gt;Why Use Options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why use options rather than buy and sell shares? There are multiple reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the buy side&lt;/strong&gt;, options offer &lt;em&gt;leverage&lt;/em&gt;. We said option premiums are much
cheaper than stocks. To give you an idea, let&amp;#39;s consider ATM options on
Microsoft stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an option expiring in 20 days currently sells for ~3% of the stock price
(in reality, 300% of the stock price, since an option commands 100 shares, but
to make things convenient, option prices are usually denominated relative to a
single share). For an option expiring in 50 days, the price is ~4.5%. And for
January next year, it is ~13%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s quite a discount! Of course, it comes at a price. First - there is an
expiration. If the option expires worthless, you lose the premium, whereas you
can hold stock indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;msft-header.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;msft-28-01.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, your profit margin on the 100 shares commanded by the option is reduced
by the premium you paid. It is always more profitable to buy 100 shares than a
call, in absolute terms (absolute meaning &amp;quot;if you ignore the amount that you
need to invest&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s where leverage comes in: because options are much cheaper, you can buy
more of them compared to the stock - and so if you profit, the profit typically
ends up much higher for the same amount of money invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sell side&lt;/strong&gt; is where, according to me, options really shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While buying options (or shares) lets you make money by betting whether the
stock will go up or down, selling options lets you make money by betting that
the stock price will not fall below a certain price, or rise above a certain
price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me at least, that&amp;#39;s a much easier bet. Stock prices are swingy and hard to
predict, but I find it much easier to find conservative bounds for the price
movement (especially on the down side).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, this has the magical property of letting you profit &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; a stock
has run up in price. For instance, say a stock flies up from 10$ to 20$. You
think it won&amp;#39;t go back under 13$, and/or you wouldn&amp;#39;t mind owning it as that
price (as it is likely to go flying back up at some point in the future). Then
you can sell a put with a 13$ strike price expiring in a few feeks. The best
thing is, because of the recent price spike, there will be high demand
(&lt;em&gt;volatility&lt;/em&gt;) for the options and you&amp;#39;re likely to sell it a a higher price
compared to a similarly-priced, but stable stock. Of course, selling the put
when the stock was worth 10$ or 13$ would have been even more profitable, but
back then it was much more risky (as its upside was still uncertain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, selling option lets you do all kind of fancy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theoptionsguide.com/option-trading-strategies.aspx&quot;&gt;options combo
strategies&lt;/a&gt;. I will list a few at the end of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-wheel&quot;&gt;The Wheel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I&amp;#39;m dying to tell you more about option pricing. Because I&amp;#39;m
apparently a finance nerd now, and I find this super cool, but also because it
enables very interesting trading strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that wasn&amp;#39;t quite the premise of this article, which was to describe a
fairly conservative strategy using options. I still think you should understand
option pricing if you&amp;#39;re going to use them, but you don&amp;#39;t need to understand all
the intricacies to understand the strategy. So here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy is called &lt;strong&gt;the wheel&lt;/strong&gt;. It proceeds as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You pick a series of stock you like. These stock should be stable (mostly:
very unlikely to go down a lot). They don&amp;#39;t need to be very volatile, but they
do need to be just volatile enough that the whole thing is worth your risk
(I&amp;#39;ll discuss numbers later). I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend running this on market-wide
&lt;a href=&quot;/stock-market-intro/&quot;&gt;ETFs&lt;/a&gt; for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You sell cash-secured puts on the stocks you identified. A cash-secured put is
just a put where you own the cash to buy the shares should you get assigned.
You should pick a strike where you feel the stock is fairly- or under-valued.
The expiration should in ~30 days (after that, the price of options start
declining faster towards expiration, see section on option pricing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You wait 30 days, and one of two things happen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock is over the strike at expiration. You get to keep the premium.
You can re-start the process and again sell some puts on the stock (or on
another stock if you prefer).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock did go down, you get assigned, and you now own 100 shares of
the stock. The next phase of the strategy begins here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You now sell covered calls on the stock. A covered call is when you sell a
call where you own the underlying stock. This is very safe since, should you
get assigned, you can sell the stock you already own. The downside is that if
the stock skyrockets, you will lose the upside, since the call you sold forces
you to sell at the specified price. The game here is to select a strike that
is a bit above where you think the stock could reach. If you think the stock
could skyrocket, then just don&amp;#39;t sell the covered call - that&amp;#39;s fine (and
smart) too. Like before, pick a ~30 days expiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like before, after 30 days, either the call expired worthless, and you can
sell another covered call — or you&amp;#39;ve been assigned. In that case you make a
double profit: the premium which is yours no matter what, plus the difference
between the price at which you bought the shares and the strike price. Your
capital is now freed to start another wheel cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I should really give you an example trade. I&amp;#39;m lazy, so I will
simply redirect you to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFYrFeAygfc&amp;amp;list=PLI2eVMd1wtdGwFXMFya1jHpWLvWw6a07X&quot;&gt;appropriate video&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI2eVMd1wtdGwFXMFya1jHpWLvWw6a07X&quot;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; I linked
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk numbers. You should aim for the premium collect when selling the
options to be high enough. Jun Hao from the videos I linked before recommends a
minimum of 2%. That comes up to a 24% of profit a year, which is fairly
reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in pratice, you&amp;#39;ll often achieve much better returns than 24%. That&amp;#39;s
because at some point your covered calls get assigned, you you get the pocket
the increase in the stock price. Even for a stock that isn&amp;#39;t too volatile, that
could be a ~10% increase (it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; for it be much more, if the stock
price increases consistently but never reaches the strike of the calls that
you&amp;#39;re selling month after month).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the downside? Well the downside is the downside of the stock. You can
only lose money in this strategy if the stock loses value. That&amp;#39;s why picking
good stocks is important. There is a lot to be written about stock picking and
fundamental analysis, but that won&amp;#39;t be in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact I&amp;#39;m not currently very inclined to write about valuation - I don&amp;#39;t feel
like I could tell you much more than a few good youtube channels. In fact here
are three recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/GrowingWealth/playlists&quot;&gt;Growing Wealth&lt;/a&gt; - the source of the videos linked before. Solid
advice, nothing super exciting, but this is what I would recommend to most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/AdamKhoo/playlists&quot;&gt;Adam Khoo&lt;/a&gt; - fairly basic and repetitive, but basic is what you want to
start at. He&amp;#39;s a fairly entertaining speaker, so maybe this could go down
better for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/AswathDamodaranonValuation/playlists&quot;&gt;Aswath Damodaran&lt;/a&gt; - a NY Stern professor no less, who shares his
valuation and corporate finance classes online. I intend to follow the 2021
class as it is being posted. From what I&amp;#39;ve seen so far, it&amp;#39;s top-notch, but
slightly technical. Maybe not for complete beginners, unless you&amp;#39;re quite
curious. Otherwise, follow some lighter content (podcasts etc) on the market first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the downside of the strategy. The downside is strictly less than owning
stock. Think about it: not only do you enter at an advantageous point (low
price), but you get paid a premium monthly before and after holding. Even in
case of loss, you will lose as much as the stock lost, minus all the premium you
collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real price of the strategy is missing out on profits. If you really believe
in a stock, don&amp;#39;t wait until you puts are called, just buy out, or you could
miss out. Similarly, if a stock is really poised for growth, selling covered
call could amount to selling away most of your profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, this strategy pays on stable stocks where you like the fundamentals
and/or the prospects, but where you also don&amp;#39;t that the stock is currently
selling at a bargain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;honestly-what-ive-been-doing&quot;&gt;Honestly, What I&amp;#39;ve Been Doing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the wheel strategy is sort of my base plan. However, in practice, I&amp;#39;ve
deviated from it significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I mostly sell puts, and I rarely get assigned. And second, I
mostly sell puts on relatively hyped stocks, and consequently collect more
premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems relatively contradictory, but in fact isn&amp;#39;t necessarily. Because the
stocks are popular, they have high volatility, meaning the premiums are higher.
Because of that, I can afford to pick a lower strike price (hence also a lower
premium) and still make a respectable profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it must be said that the market right now is an euphoric bull market. I
would be foolish, I feel, to assume that this will last forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;stonks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another difference from the wheel strategy is that my puts are not all
cash-secured (this is only possible if you trade &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp&quot;&gt;on margin&lt;/a&gt;). Since my puts
mostly don&amp;#39;t get called, this is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I must be wary of a particular risk: if the market &lt;em&gt;turns&lt;/em&gt; and goes
into a downtrend, I could potential be facing assignment on many/most of my
puts, which would &amp;quot;blow my account&amp;quot; (since this is more money than I have
because the puts are not cash-secured). I&amp;#39;m actively monitoring for such a
risk - it can be avoided by buying back the puts while there is still time
(which isn&amp;#39;t necessarily easy to do — trading psychology is fascinating and
would probably deserve a blog post, a book review, or both).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also been relatively bummed by my experiences with selling cash-covered
calls. There were a few stocks I really liked, that I acquired by selling puts
very close to the money (I didn&amp;#39;t mind getting called since I liked the stock).
I wanted to follow the strategy and sold the puts, but ultimately I would have
done better to just let them ride - I was cut out of a major part of the gains
that the stocks made immediately after I was assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another experience was a much more stable stock, where I felt like the amount of
premium collected didn&amp;#39;t justify the risk taken by the stock going down (and it
was going down).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this is also due to the market being so hyper recently. If things
tend to go up, selling covered calls is probably not the best move. I expect
this leg of the strategy will make more sense in boring times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;option-pricing&quot;&gt;Option Pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a key thing to be able to trade effectively with options is to
understand what influences the price of options (the premium).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very important to understand that the price of the options, just like the
price of the underlying stock, is set by the market. i.e. the price is what
someone is willing to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, though this is not super important here, there are two components
to the price: the bid (what someone is willing to pay) and the ask (what
someone is willing to sell for). When the two component meet, an option is
sold. The different between the bid and the ask is called &amp;quot;the spread&amp;quot;. In a
liquid market with a lot of transaction volume, the spread is small. In an
illiquid market where not much is happening, the spread is wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the price of options is influenced by four key factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the price of the underlying stock (obviously)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the time remaining until expiration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the risk-free rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the price of options can be modelled using these factors, plus a fourth
one (&lt;em&gt;volatility&lt;/em&gt;). The most popular model is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model&quot;&gt;Black-Scholes model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;volatility&quot;&gt;Volatility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility is the last factor that helps to fit the model to the market price.
You can think of volatility as &amp;quot;demand&amp;quot;: when volatility is high there is a lot
of trading activity, hence demand for options, meaning the premium rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility is typically correlated with sudden changes or swings in the
underlyings stock price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because volatility helps the model fit to reality, it is called &lt;em&gt;implied
volatility&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;IV&lt;/strong&gt; for short. External conditions influence the demand for
options, which is reflected in the price, and then we use the Black-Scholes
model to extract a quantified measure of &amp;quot;volatility&amp;quot; from the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each stock has its own implied volatility. What qualifies as &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; IV varies
from stock to stock. Some stocks are inherently more stable than other.
Volatility can also be measured at the level of the market — this is notably
done through &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX&quot;&gt;the VIX index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also theoretically possible to have a stock that has high IV without
exhibiting erratic price movements in the underlying stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied volatility is expressed in percentage. This percentage represents the
predicted standard deviation range for the price of the underlying in the next
year. So a 100$ stock with an IV of 25% is expected to end within the 75-125$
price range after a year, with 68% probability (one standard deviation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the implied volatility predicts the expected price? Essentially, the
higher market participants are willing to bid on an option, the higher the
expected price movement — traders are willing to pay more because they expect a
big move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An open question (that I can&amp;#39;t answer): why is the range traditionally centered
on the current stock price? This is obviously wrong for many stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-risk-free-rate&quot;&gt;The Risk-Free Rate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, before we dive in the really important stuff, let&amp;#39;s evacuate something
that is (currently) not very important: the risk-free rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk-free rate represents the rate of return of a risk-free investment. It&amp;#39;s
typically embodied by the yield of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield&quot;&gt;US treasury bonds&lt;/a&gt; — which can&amp;#39;t default
unless the US government defaults, at which point we&amp;#39;d all have other worries
than the marginal return rates of our options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s mostly a non-factor because this rate is at the moment relatively stable,
and relatively low. The American federal reserved has vowed to keep this rate
low for at least the next two years. I&amp;#39;m a bit in over my head here, but from
what I understand, it is widely considered that letting the interest rate
increase would do bad things to do economy, and nobody seems particularly eager
to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of the risk-free rate as a factor in option price is simple: when the
risk-free rate of return increase, you will demande increased returns for the
risk that you actually take — which in this case takes the form of decreased
premiums. It&amp;#39;s also interesting to note that since the option seller pockets the
premium up front (and not at expiration), an increased risk-free rate implies a
greater ability for him to compound the premium until expiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;option-greeks&quot;&gt;Option Greeks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used tool to analyze option prices are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)&quot;&gt;option greeks&lt;/a&gt;.
The option greeks represent the variation of the option price relative to the
factor we listed before (so they are derivatives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the first-order greeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta&lt;/strong&gt; (Δ): the most important one, how much does the price of the option increase
(or decrease) when the price of the underlying stock moves by 1$ (like most
numbers used with options, you actually need to multiply the quoted number by
100 to obtain the correct figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theta&lt;/strong&gt; (Θ): represents how the price of the option drops as time passes. It
is expressed as a drop per year, but that number is actually meaningless,
because theta increases constantly (and predictably) until expiration (more
about this in a bit). To get a more useful figure, you should divide the
quoted number by 365 (or by 3.65, remember the 100 factor) to get a daily
drop. Note that options drop in value (all else being equal) even during the
weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vega&lt;/strong&gt; (𝑉): represents how the price of the option increases/decreases when
the implied volatility increases/decreases 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this may sound a bit weird, because we said earlier that IV is computed
from the option price and not the other way round. Indeed, getting the value
of vega is as simple as plugging the a reduced IV value in the Black-Scholes
model and getting out the new price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nevertheless useful, because it helps us visualize how the option
price would move if demand for the option were to increase/decrease (which in
everyday talk will often be said as &amp;quot;if volatility were to increase&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting anecdote: vega is not a greek letter. It is typically represent by
a variant uppercase representation of the greek nu (ν) which doesn&amp;#39;t even have
a dedicated unicode character (I used the best approximation &amp;quot;mathematic
italic capital V&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rho&lt;/strong&gt; (ρ): the least used one, representing how much the price
increases/decreases if the risk-free rate increases/decreases by 1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key considerations when dealing with greeks is that they all represent a rate
of change relative to a given variable (price, time, volatility, risk-free rate)
&lt;strong&gt;when all else stays equal&lt;/strong&gt;. Said otherwise, the value of every greek depends
on every variable. This is why not every option with 30 days until expiration
has the same theta - of course the option price for a 10$ stock isn&amp;#39;t going to
drop as much over time as the option price for a 1000$ stock! The same goes for
every other variable. Let us now go over some of these interesting correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with delta. Delta is about 0.5 when the option is at the money. The
more the option gets in the money, the more delta increases, and the more it
gets out of the money, the more it decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;delta-vs-price.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? If you own a 10$ call on a 1000$ stock, there is almost no option-specific
risk involved in holding the option, so every extra dollar in the underlying
price will translate to extra dollar in the option price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we can show that the price of an ITM call option must exceed
&lt;code&gt;stock_price - strike_price&lt;/code&gt;. It that weren&amp;#39;t the case, you could exercise the
option and immediately make a profit by selling the shares (in reality you would
need for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.optionstrading.org/introduction/how-options-really-work/settlement/&quot;&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; of the shares after exercising the option). A similar
logic applies for put option, where the intrinsic value is &lt;code&gt;strike_price - stock_price&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of options can be divided into two parts. First, the &lt;strong&gt;intrinsic
value&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the aforementiond &lt;code&gt;stock_price - strike_price&lt;/code&gt; factor (or
vice-versa for puts). This factor is capped at 0, however: ATM and OTM shares
have a 0 intrinsic value, not a negative one. Second, the &lt;strong&gt;time value&lt;/strong&gt; which
represents the potential for the option to appreciate and potentially get in the
money (or further in the money).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For call options, the intrinsic value is maximal at the 0 strike price, a point
where the time value is also minimal. For puts, it&amp;#39;s a bit more complicated, but
if far enough strikes are available (*), you will also find put options where the
option price is roughly equal to the intrinsic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(*) The exchange decides how far the available strikes go, as well as the
increment between two available strike prices!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time value is maximal at the money, and decreases the further out in the
money or at the money the option goes. We said the time value represent the
potential for appreciation of the option. It does make sense that an option far
out of the money is unlikely to ever go into the money, while an option far in
the money will more or less move in lockstep with the underlying stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s tackle this from another angle. Buying a deeply ITM option is like holding
stock: there is not much more risk than holding the stock. For this reason, the
time value is small — the price of the option will move in lockstep with the
underlying. But because the option is far in the money, the intrinsic value is
large, and the option is pricey compared to an ATM option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying a deeply OTM option, on the other hand, is more like buying a lottery
ticket. It&amp;#39;s very likely it will expire worthless. Even if the underlying moves
in the right direction and you sell before expiration, the price increase will
be small because the further OTM an option is, the smaller delta is. This is
therefore mostly a bet on an explosive change in the underlying price. For such
a bet to make sense, the option price has to be very low. The intrinsic value is
zero, and the time value is low, since the bet is very unlikely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the middle, ATM options have 0 intrinsic value, but maximal time
value. That&amp;#39;s because they are the most &lt;em&gt;swingy&lt;/em&gt; of options. Since delta is also
maximal (0.5) at the money, the price of ATM options will respond the fastest to
changes in the price of the underlying. If your option is ATM a few days before
expiration, even a 3% price move is often the difference between a 100% loss and
100% profit at expiration. This potential for a quick profit is what makes the
time value high at the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we should mention that, just like time value, theta (the time decay) is
greatest at the money. This is because an option has 0 time value at expiration,
so the time value must tend to zero over time. When there is more time value
(because the option is ATM), it therefore has to decrease faster over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;theta-vs-price.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Theta vs Price&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the chart above, the options are ATM and the underlying price is 6. Notice
how the curve flattens when the remaining time diminishes — because the time
value does too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentionned somewhere above, the time values decays increasingly fast as
expiration nears, and so does theta accelarate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;theta-vs-time.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;price-vs-time.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Time Value vs Time&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the chart above &amp;quot;option value&amp;quot; should really be &amp;quot;time value&amp;quot;. The option
may still have intrinsic value at expiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In passing, note that delta also varies with time. At expiration, ITM options
(no matter how far) have a delta of 1 (intrinsic value == price), while OTM
options have a delta of 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;delta-vs-time.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with this, I conclude my rather long exposition on options pricing. The
topic is even broader than this. For instance, we didn&amp;#39;t talk about the
second-order greek gamma (Γ) which played a major role in the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze&quot;&gt;GameStop
rally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chosen Tidbits 7</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Part of the &lt;a href=&quot;/chosen-tidbits&quot;&gt;Chosen Tidbits&lt;/a&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/&quot;&gt;You Can&amp;#39;t Tell People Anything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s going on is that without some kind of direct experience to use as a
touchstone, people don’t have the context that gives them a place in their
minds to put the things you are telling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things you say often don&amp;#39;t stick, and the few things that do stick are often
distorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, most people aren&amp;#39;t very good at visualizaing hypothetitcals, at imagining
what something they haven&amp;#39;t experienced might be like if it were somewhat
different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing might help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you create things that you can keep on the market at a very low cost
(including your time), you almost cannot fail. Worst case scenario is a slow
success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your running costs are high, time becomes your enemy. Your profits must
beat the clock, or you go bust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your running costs are negligible, time becomes your friend. You cannot go
bust, and the passage of time exposes you to luck 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself wondering, or just feeling, &amp;quot;Why is everyone I wind up
dealing with an asshole?&amp;quot; you might want to consider the possibility that you
have set up an asshole filter. Asshole filters are an extremely common
phenomenon, and an extremely common problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An asshole filter happens when you publicly promulgate a straitened contact
boundary and then don&amp;#39;t enforce it; or worse, reward the people who transgress
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: promulgate that mails mails must go through team mail, but still answer
your private emails or even &lt;em&gt;expedite&lt;/em&gt; the requests your receive there, thereby
rewarding transgressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this post because of my endless frustration with my friends who have
the most slack in life also being the most risk averse. They have plenty of
savings but stay in soul-sucking jobs for years. They complain about the
monotony of social life but refuse to instigate a change. They don’t travel,
don’t do drugs, don’t pick fights, don’t flirt, don’t express themselves. They
don’t want to think about kids because their lives are just so comfortable and
why would you mess with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening&quot;&gt;The Silence is Deafening&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Angry Alice tweets something obnoxious or unproductive, reasonable people
just scroll past it. If Alice develops a pattern of bad behavior, reasonable
people will just unfollow, mute, or block her. The result is that it&amp;#39;s hard for
Alice to notice the silent majority of people who saw the trash fire and walked
away when they recognized that engaging would only fuel its flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets worse—Angry Alice only sees feedback from extremists, so she doesn&amp;#39;t
receive more nuanced signals that might actually cause her to reflect on her
behavior. If no reasonable people give feedback, only the unreasonable people
are left. From Alice&amp;#39;s perspective, the only people who disagree with her are
jerks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a coordination problem. Reasonable people understand that if they join
the fray alone, they&amp;#39;ll most likely be drowned out by the yelling, or worse
they&amp;#39;ll get dragged deeper into it. As a result, they choose stay out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge part of the problem is that digital spaces generally have no equivalent
of a disapproving glare. You&amp;#39;re stuck choosing between staying silent and
entering the fray, with few options in between. If you have little reason to
believe that other reasonable people will back you up, you&amp;#39;re going to stick
with the default: silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tolerance is not a moral precept, it&amp;#39;s a peace treaty (or at least non-agression).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One can&amp;#39;t tolerate the intolerant, that would be a suicide pact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thread illustrates that telling your children the functional lie that they
have bodily autonomy is exhausting to stick to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1281406459855634437&quot;&gt;Fuck Victimhood Identity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that long ago I noticed that the less I saw and presented
myself as a victim, the less I was victimized. This kicked off a virtuous
cycle that I’m not going to jeopardize. Now my life is much improved, and I’ve
developed a very strong allergy to victim identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spiral of victim identity is incredibly seductive. Once you step in it
your identity will be reinforced by everyone around you and your own
confirmation bias. I’ve seen this spiral claim people, groups, nations. It
didn’t make them better off, and it didn’t make them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victimhood blinds you to the suffering of others. My dating life improved when
I stopped thinking about how women malign me and became able to understand
their own fears and frustrations with guys. Before, I literally couldn’t
fathom that dating can be hard for hot young women&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victimhood blinds you to your own mistakes, the only part you can change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants their suffering validated, but you will never get this
validation from those who hurt you if that’s what you seek. If you let go of
this doomed desire, you may eventually find the validation you crave among
friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t have to argue about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you’re fighting, &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; you’re fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to do both at once is a quick way to compound your frustration with each
other and make things worse for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smart thing to do is to schedule relationship maintenance in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1168145452379729921&quot;&gt;Visa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nabeelqu.co/understanding&quot;&gt;How to Understand Things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father has zero intellectual insecurities... It has never crossed his mind
to be concerned that the world thinks he’s an idiot. He’s not in that game. So
if he doesn’t understand something, he just asks you. He doesn’t care if he
sounds foolish. He will ask the most obvious question without any sort of
concern about it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people are not willing to do this — looking stupid takes courage, and
sometimes it’s easier to just let things slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is striking how many situations I am in where I start asking basic
questions, feel guilty for slowing the group down, and it turns out that
nobody understood what was going on to begin with (often people message me
privately saying that they’re relieved I asked), but I was the only one who
actually spoke up and asked about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://garybasin.com/one-week-project-management/&quot;&gt;One Week Project Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a big project is tricky. I usually have some sense of what needs to
be done, but my time estimates tend to be… a little off. There’s one thing
worse than underestimating the time it’ll take: doing unnecessary work. I hate
getting traction on a project only to realize that a bunch of work was wasted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a trick that often works for me: Rescope the project to complete it
within the next week. Even when unrealistic, trying to apply that tight
constraint can get you to notice things you wouldn’t otherwise. It forces me
to consider what is absolutely necessary and what can be skipped. It forces me
to spend one of my days planning so I know exactly what I need to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Parkinson’s Law] states that a project takes as much time as you allow it.
Once in a while, try allowing much less time than you think is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cynical view of humanity at large informs my sympathetic view of actual
humans. By the standards of horny status-obsessed murder monkeys, even my
outgroup enemies are often doing the best they can consider the fears and
insecurities that plague them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you believe that humans are by nature benign and kind and
are only &amp;quot;corrupted&amp;quot; by culture, you will have a very negative view of the
prevailing culture and most people. This will tempt you to dream of revolutions
or a return to some golden age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
