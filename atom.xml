      <title>Language Design Notes 0: A Map of Polymorphism</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;This is the first post in &lt;a href=&quot;/language-design-notes&quot;&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; where I write my thoughts on some aspects
of language design. This first installment will deal with polymorphism, what it
is, and how it manifests in its three main forms, which we review below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;ad-hoc-polymorphism&quot;&gt;Ad-Hoc Polymorphism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically polymorphism has to do with the ability to reuse the same code for
different types of values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamically-typed languages are very polymorphic, since any storage location
(variable, field) can hold any value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions in dynamically-typed language exhibit &lt;strong&gt;ad-hoc polymorphism&lt;/strong&gt;, which
is to say that functions may work even when supplied arguments of different
types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just don&amp;#39;t need to know the type of a value. If you&amp;#39;re just going
to store it in a collection, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes it&amp;#39;s ultimately necessary to separate the behaviour for different
types. This is done either through another kind of polymorphism (often
&lt;em&gt;subtyping polymorphism&lt;/em&gt;), or by checking the type explicitly and branching out
in different execution path on that basis. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def foo(x):
    if type(x) is Bar:
        foo_bar(x)
    elif type(x) is Baz:
        foo_baz(x)
    else
        raise TypeError(&amp;quot;x is neither Bar nor Baz&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people also say that &lt;em&gt;overloading&lt;/em&gt; in statically-typed languages (having
multiple functions with the same name, but differing in the type of their
arguments) counts as polymorphism. I&amp;#39;m not anal about definitions, but
overloading isn&amp;#39;t what I&amp;#39;m talking about here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that (unlike every other types of &amp;quot;polymorphism&amp;quot;), overloading
doesn&amp;#39;t compose. The specific overload that gets called must be determined
statically. As such the type must be fully determined — we can&amp;#39;t use a type
parameter (cf. &lt;em&gt;parametric polymorphism&lt;/em&gt;) and the specific subtype (cf.
&lt;em&gt;subtyping polymorphism&lt;/em&gt;) isn&amp;#39;t taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, you can never reuse code that calls an overloaded function for
multiple types. Overloading is ultimately just a naming convenience: you could
give each overload its own name and nothing would change. (There is an exception
to that rule, see the discussion of C++ templates below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, ad-hoc polymorphism can also appear in statically typed languages,
either via a super type (e.g. &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt; in Java, but any shared super type will
do) or some other wildcard type that is cast-compatible with the others (e.g.
&lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt; in C). Using these types essentially brings us back to a &amp;quot;dynamically
typed&amp;quot; scenario, except we can&amp;#39;t directly call functions we know exist: we have
to cast the values to their proper types first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In statically-typed languages, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-sensitive_typing&quot;&gt;flow typing&lt;/a&gt; and union types (e.g. in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://ceylon-lang.org/documentation/1.3/tour/types/&quot;&gt;Ceylon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/new-types/union-types.html&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;) can help make ad-hoc
polymorphism more palatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;subtyping-inclusion-polymorphism&quot;&gt;Subtyping/Inclusion Polymorphism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another popular type of polymorphism is &lt;strong&gt;subtyping (or inclusion)
polymorphism&lt;/strong&gt;. This is your standard object-oriented class and sub-class
scenario, but also includes things like interface implementations, traits, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one works for both dynamically- and statically-typed languages. It&amp;#39;s
straightforward in statically-typed languages: you put a type on a parameter,
and the function can also accept any argument that is a subtype of that type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamically-typed languages of the OO variety also have inheritance, but in that
case I&amp;#39;m not sure if it should be considered as subtyping or ad-hoc polymorphism
(and it matters little). The thing is that you can have OO polymorphism without
even sharing a superclass. A function can call a method on an object, and has
long as the object does implement a method by that name, it will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said otherwise, the interfaces can be left implicit, the following method is
polymorphic for any object that has both a &lt;code&gt;bar()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;baz()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def foo(x):
    x.bar()
    x.baz()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;parametric-polymorphism&quot;&gt;Parametric Polymorphism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, last of the big three, we have &lt;strong&gt;parametric polymorphism&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a
few famous examples of that: generics in Java and C#, templates in C++.
Basically you endow bits of code (typically functions and data structures) with
type parameters that allow specializing the code for the given type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its most basic, parametric polymorphism for functions is the equivalent of
ad-hoc polymorphism for statically-typed languages: it allows you to call the
same code with values different types, but also preserves the specific type
being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the parametrized code must range over multiple types, the available
information is limited. At worse, you know nothing, but you can also have a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/bounded.html&quot;&gt;type bound&lt;/a&gt; that gives a common supertype (if also using &lt;em&gt;subtyping
polymorphism&lt;/em&gt;) or some other information that constraint the valid type
arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, like ad-hoc polymorphism, if you ultimately want to do something specific to
the actual type, you either have to perform a cast, or rely on subtyping polymorphism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can further distinguish different realization of parametric polymorphism.
With Java and C# generics, the same (binary) code is used regardless of the
actual type arguments being used. In C++ templates, the code is automatically
duplicated and specialized for the specific type arguments. This has both pros
and cons. While Java/C# are limited to accepting object types (i.e. pointers) as
type arguments, C++ can accept any pointer, structure or primitive type — even
if they have different size in memory. The downside is that all the duplication
can bloat the binary size, something significantly so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++ templates are essentially a form of (turing-complete!) macro-expansion. They
are compiled using something called &amp;quot;two phase lookup&amp;quot;. The template definition
is checked for basic syntactic errors, but the check for the existence of the
function calls in the template only occurs when the template is instantiated for
particular type arguments. An interesting consequence of this is that templates
can &amp;quot;redeem&amp;quot; overloading: the same source code can now call different overloads
by virtue of being specialized automatically by C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the way, yes, C macros can also be regarded as polymorphism. They can
redeem overloading in the same way as templates, though C doesn&amp;#39;t have
overloading — but that can be papered over by using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Typeof.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; GCC
extension&lt;/a&gt;. A big difference is that C macros cannot be called automatically —
if you write a specializable function with it, you&amp;#39;ll have to instantiated it
yourself for any type you want to use it with! More advanced types of macros
(e.g. Lisp macros) may take things even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java and C# generics also differ in one different respect: the erasure or
reification of type arguments. C# actually makes the type arguments available to
the user code, which can use it to perform type checks, type casts, type
reflection... Type arguments are essentially converted to additional arguments
of the generic function. Java, on the other hand, &lt;em&gt;erases&lt;/em&gt; the type arguments
form the bytecode it generates, so the aforementioned use cases are not
possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downsides of reified generics? Apparently, performance. It&amp;#39;s hard to find a good
analysis of that claim, but Gilad Bracha &lt;a href=&quot;https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2018/10/reified-generics-search-for-cure.html&quot;&gt;made it&lt;/a&gt; based on his
work on the Dart VM, and I&amp;#39;m inclined to believe it. Still the statement isn&amp;#39;t
qualified: how bad is it, really?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Language Design Notes</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting a new series on (more or less) disjointed notes on programming
langauge design and related concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the work-in-progress index to the series, which also gives a bit more
context about each post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;0-a-map-of-polymorphism&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/polymorphism&quot;&gt;0. A Map of Polymorphism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original impetus for the series was to write about a couple ideas I had for
language design. The first idea was to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class&quot;&gt;typeclasses&lt;/a&gt; extensively, but freed
of their Haskell shackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way to introduce the topic, I wrote an overview of the different types of
polymorphisms. This ended up quite disjointed from what I have now written on
typeclasses (I&amp;#39;m not done yet). Nevertheless, it&amp;#39;s not too shabby as a reference
on polymorphism, so here goes!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More Content, Less Perfectionism</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I want to be writing more here in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some stuff in the pipe, but an issue I keep running into is
perfectionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfectionism can be a good thing, it&amp;#39;s what made write the super complete
&lt;a href=&quot;http://norswap.com/ruby-dark-corners/&quot;&gt;Ruby&amp;#39;s Dark Corners&lt;/a&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I probably could put out more stuff if I accepted to just
publish bits and pieces as I write them. The issue is that often, there needs to
be some kind of internal consistency to a series, and I&amp;#39;m uneasy to put out the
first part if I think the later part might make me to wish to edit it (which it
usually does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But publishing things feels good! It feels like momentum and progress being
done. Some of my other post series have been done in a much more &amp;quot;good enough&amp;quot;
spirit, including my notes on weight-lifting and anime opinions. Let&amp;#39;s do more
of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the spirit of experimentation, I&amp;#39;m going to try to put out more stuff,
including stuff that isn&amp;#39;t as finished as I would like it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, nothing prevents me to re-edit it later, if that&amp;#39;s what I really
wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I&amp;#39;d like to apply this philosophy to more than just writing on my
blog, but it&amp;#39;s a good start. And I want to write about what I do on my blog
anyway, so starting here will impact the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head nod to Venkatesh Rao&amp;#39;s idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/mediocratopia-2/&quot;&gt;mediocrity being actually
good&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing coming up is going to be articles in a series of more or less
disjointed notes about language design and relevant concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to publish a more shorter things, mostly highlighting cool things
I&amp;#39;ve encountered elsewhere — without the need to add much value personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Elegant Optional Arguments in Java</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Today, an adventure in programming in the in-between, not quite programming in
the small, not quite in the large either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we would like to have a Java method (or constructor) with
optional parameters: parameters who take default value as arguments if not
supplied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard way to do this would be to generate overloads with only a subset of
arguments. This is of course exponential in the number of optional parameters:
with four of them, we&amp;#39;re already generating 16 overloads! It&amp;#39;s also dependent on
optional parameters not sharing the same type, and requires one to remember the
ordering of parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better solution: create a configuration object to hold all optional arguments.
This is good, but shifts the issue of optional parameters to the instantiation
of the configuration object. One solution is have a no-argument constructor and
use setters to specify the non-default values. This can be relatively terse and
elegant by means of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-the-builder-pattern&quot;&gt;builder pattern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also possible to forego the configuration object and store the
configuration directly on the concerned object. But there is the risk to clutter
the object, muddling the public interface of the class. It&amp;#39;s better to separate
concerns so that configuration data is separate from other fields (&amp;quot;work data&amp;quot;,
stored items, ...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there you have it, if you require more than one or two optional parameters,
or you feel the set of optional parameters may grow, consider whipping up
configuration object with the builder pattern!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>More Weightlifting Observations</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Previously: &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training&quot;&gt;Starting Weight Training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;progression&quot;&gt;Progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training&quot;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; was written two months after I started training. It&amp;#39;s now been
about 7 months. The time the post was written ended up being somewhat
unfortunate, because I almost immediately had to deload some of my lifts. My
squat form was slightly subpar, and I deloaded the row and the bench press as
part of the program: if you can&amp;#39;t progress three times straight, you deload.
Some form tweaks were also applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what total progress looks like. The screencap in &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;
was taken around the 19th of May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;weights.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph of weight lifted over time.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see dips for the previously mentionned lifts in between the 11 May and
22 June bars. You should ignore the sharp dips right after the 22 June bar —
that&amp;#39;s an anomaly that occured because I changed the weights one day to make up
for having only one hour to spend at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something interesting is the huge barbell row dip. In short, I was doing barbell
row completely wrong. Part of the problem is my size: for proper form (back
horizontal) I&amp;#39;m forced to almost press my stomach to my tights, which I wasnt
doing. It&amp;#39;s also possible that lack of strength in my upper back caused other
muscles to compensate. Anyway, I finally feel like I &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; the exercise and I
can feel its effects, whereas previously it seemed pointless, too easy, and the
form was hard to judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All other dips in the graph are simply the normal &amp;quot;deload on failure&amp;quot; mechanism
kicking in. I particularly remember the squat one towards the end, which
occurred after I came back from my Ireland trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not represented in the graph, but highly relevant is the fact that I switched to
3x5 (down from 5x5) on the squat and on the bench press, at the beginning of
this month. It&amp;#39;s what the Stronglift program &lt;a href=&quot;https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#321553215312153&quot;&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, had I read that
part carefully, I might have done it earlier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one way to know if it’s time to switch from 5×5 to 3×5. If your
workouts are taking two hours because you have to rest 10mins between sets to
get 5×5… you’re probably overdoing it. Don’t get stubborn about sticking with
5×5. Switch to 3×5 so you can continue to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only ever did 3-4 mins rests between sets (and 5 on failure), but my workouts
did (and honestly still do) take 2 hours. I progressed though, so it might have
been for the best that I sticked to 5x5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another part that caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5×5 doesn’t work forever. Nothing does. The stronger you get, the heavier the
weights you can lift, and thus the bigger the stress of each 5×5 workout. That
stress eventually becomes too big for your body to recover from by the next
workout. You don’t get stronger in time so you fail reps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was exactly the situation in September, in fact it had been for some
time (at least one month). I was feeling physically quite tired a lot of the
time. Not really like brain fog, but much more like I&amp;#39;d been doing hard manual
labor all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching to 3x5 helped, but I took it further, and since two weeks I&amp;#39;m only
doing two workouts a week instead of three. With three workouts I was feeling I
really didn&amp;#39;t have enough time to recover and consolidate my gains — especially
when there was only one resting day in between workouts, and especially on the
squat which is done on every workout. I&amp;#39;m feeling pretty good about this right
now (not to mention the time savings), but we&amp;#39;ll see how it works out in the
long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;nutrition&quot;&gt;Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, I really realized I needed to eat more to be able to progress.
After some experiments, I&amp;#39;ve settled on taking bigger dinners (which were
usually lighter for me), as well as occasionally indulging in some more proteins
at lunch. I also try to be more consistently taking protein shakes twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about protein shakes, I&amp;#39;ve switched to Optimum Nutrition &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.fr/OPTIMUM-NUTRITION-Standard-Prot%C3%A9ine-Chocolat/dp/B000QSNYGI&quot;&gt;Gold Standard
Whey&lt;/a&gt;, double chocolate flavor, after a friend recommended it to me. I mix that
with milk, and the result is that it tastes a bit like milk with cocoa powder.
Finally, proteins that don&amp;#39;t taste FOUL. Thanks god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something disappointing regarding nutrition is that since I started lifting, it
seems like my body fat percentage didn&amp;#39;t really move. I didn&amp;#39;t measure it with
any precision, but while it&amp;#39;s clear I have more muscles, it isn&amp;#39;t clear at all
that I have less fat. This is annoying, because my primary objective was to look
better... I&amp;#39;ve drifted from that somewhat (discussion in the next section) but
it would be cool if I could do something about it without jeopardizing muscle
gains too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current idea is to try some form of intermittent fasting (IF). I almost
already do an 8/16 IF split where I eat only during at 8 hour window
(12:00-20:00), but I&amp;#39;m not being strict about it — I usually have some fruits or
nuts in the morning, dessert in the evening, and protein shakes of course. I
want to try being extra strict and see if it enables some fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&amp;#39;t work, I might try another of IF, which I&amp;#39;ll refer to as &amp;quot;day
fasting&amp;quot;: fast one or more whole day in the week. Some popular approaches are
alternate-day fasting (but that&amp;#39;s too much while doing the gym) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://leangains.com/&quot;&gt;Leangains&lt;/a&gt;
(twice a week + additional dietetic advice). I&amp;#39;d just do a single day with no
more constraints honestly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; does not work, I guess I&amp;#39;ll need to revert to theh good old &amp;quot;cut&amp;quot;:
losing fat while preventing muscle loss. Apparently it&amp;#39;s much harder to gain
muscle than to prevent the loss of already existing muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sleep&quot;&gt;Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the period where I was feeling very tired, I started noticing a few
effects that would definitely help my gym performance. Having some caffeine in
the morning, and some light breakfast (e.g. a fruit and a toast) before lifting
helped somewhat. Lifting in the afternoon rather than in the morning helped more
(and I&amp;#39;m now usually lifting Wednesday and Sunday afternoon). But most of all, a
good night sleep was necessary: a short night of sleep would ruin my chances at
breaking through a plateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve started tracking my sleep using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sleep.urbandroid.org/introducing-sonar-as-sensor/&quot;&gt;sonar tech&lt;/a&gt; of the application &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&quot;&gt;Sleep
as Android&lt;/a&gt;. From my research on the topic, the tracking of sleep phases doesn&amp;#39;t
really seem to be accurate. However, using the app has been an effective
incentive to get my average time in bed to 8 hours / night over the past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an experience a couple years ago — while writing my master thesis — where
I would not set any alarm clock and sleep as long as my body would require for a
few months. The results was that after a brief adjustment period where I sleeped
A LOT, I ended up sleeping 9 hours every night. Which is still a lot more than
most people get. This doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have changed (or maybe has worsened), as
even when I sleep 8.5 hours, I never wake up naturally but always from my alarm
clock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping I can try to increase my sleep even further, since apparently that&amp;#39;s
what I need. It seems to help the lifting anyhow, at least when combined with
the switch to a twice-a-week rythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;objectives-&quot;&gt;Objectives?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I set some objectives after which to re-evaluate my training
regimen. Namely: 96kg on squat, 72kg on bench press, 120kg on deadlift and 48kg
on overhead press. I&amp;#39;ve blown past all of those, and haven&amp;#39;t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason is &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t change something that works&amp;quot; and the program kept working
for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of my initial objectives was to look better. And I did look better
when I wrote last post compared to two months prior, and I do look even better
now. But it&amp;#39;s a quite subtle improvement for the amount of work put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is two-fold: first, I have too much fat and that hinders muscle
definition; second, I experience relatively little muscle hypertrophy (my
muscles are strong, but not that big).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(However, I&amp;#39;ll note my weight gains have been relatively steady, following an
initial burst. I&amp;#39;m now at 86kg.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are well-known easy solutions for those things: go into a cut to get rid
of the fat (cf. last section) and switch to a hypertrophy/bodybuilding program
for muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is... I have some aversion to switching from the path delineated by
the program and its advanced versions. One reason might be
familiarity/change-aversion. Another is that I really enjoy constantly beating
my records and seeing the numbers go up. I&amp;#39;m also quite curious. How far can I
go? If I stop on the strength training path, will I ever be able to come back
and see? Doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I could alternate hypertrophy and strength training, at least experiment
to see if it&amp;#39;s a viable strategy. But I&amp;#39;m still progressing with the current
strategy, and it has well-defined changes to implement in case I stall anyway
(go to 3x5 than 3x3, switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stronglifts.com/madcow-5x5/&quot;&gt;Madcow&lt;/a&gt;, switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-advanced-strength-muscle-building-training-program/&quot;&gt;StrongLifts advanced&lt;/a&gt;,
switch to &lt;a href=&quot;https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/recommended_routines&quot;&gt;5/3/1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade-off outlined before me is simple: risk being unoptimal — maybe I would
look better and be stronger faster if I alternated hypertrophy with strength
training; or risk completely wasting my time and jeopardize my motivation — if I
blow the hypertrophy approach or it doesn&amp;#39;t end up being beneficial for my
strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I&amp;#39;m staying on the straigth and narrow, but I&amp;#39;m open to re-evaluate when
the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Static Website Generation, Incrementally</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;The piece of Javascript that generates this very website has to be one of the
most zen piece of code I ever wrote. I wrote about it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://norswap.com/ribosome-static-site/&quot;&gt;an article back in
2016&lt;/a&gt;. It has served me well since, and hasn&amp;#39;t broken on me the way
that I would have expected something written in Ruby to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet not all was perfect. The whole website took mabye 15-20 seconds to generate,
and complete generation was the only option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, it was my project to implement incremental generation: only
re-generate the parts of the content that have actually changed. I also wanted a
&lt;em&gt;watch&lt;/em&gt; feature: the ability to auto-regenerate content whenever I saved a
source file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve achieved these objectives, and this blog post is about that. Before I dive
in, however, a remark with the benefit of hindsight. Should I have done this at
all? The &lt;em&gt;watch&lt;/em&gt; feature had to be done, but otherwise, if my objective was to
speed up generation, maybe I should have gone and figured exactly why the
generation process was so slow... because 15-20 seconds for ~50 blog posts is
VERY slow, even for Javascript. I haven&amp;#39;t done that, but I think I should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the good part. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/norswap/norswap.github.io/blob/f643a18ef7681ecfc176265ae66629decc19ec1e/.factory/generate.js&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the resulting code.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process started with a lot of refactoring: pounding what was essentially a
linear script into functions that could be reused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;async-await-fun&quot;&gt;Async/Await Fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of that refactoring, I also made sure that all the calls that touched
the file systems were now using &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/async&quot;&gt;promises with async and await&lt;/a&gt;. This was
mostly for fun and my own education, because &lt;a href=&quot;http://sustrik.github.io/ribosome/&quot;&gt;Ribosome&lt;/a&gt; — the templating library
I use — is fully synchronous. I also think it might be responsible for the slow
execution times (or maybe just my use of it which involve writing then reading
to a temp file once per post), but that&amp;#39;s an investigation for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think async is great however, although there were a few pitfalls I fell right
in. As you may know, using async functions guarantees linear execution without
crazy callback pyramid of doom... if you use the &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; keyword! It&amp;#39;s easy to
forget it and it causes no warning (by design, this is not a complain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Async also required me to get ... creative in one instance. The package I use
for watching the file system takes a callback to which it supplies an array of
events that occured since last time the callback was called. The problem is that
this callback is never &lt;code&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;ed, even if it returns a promise. As such, if you
do async stuff within that callback (and I did), it&amp;#39;s very possible that the
package will fire another callback before the last one finished processing. This
was not acceptable to me: each set of filesystem changes had to be fully
processed before the processing of the nex tone began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how I solved it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-Javascript&quot;&gt;async function watch()
{
    let lock = Promise.resolve()
    ...
    const watching = await watcher(..., async (events) =&amp;gt; {
        let resolve
        const old_lock = lock
        lock = new Promise((r, _) =&amp;gt; resolve = r)
        await old_lock
        ...
        // process events
        ...
        resolve()
    })
    watching.start()
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, each invocation of the callback creates a &amp;quot;lock&amp;quot; object, which is an
unfullfilled promise. It then waits on the previous lock to be fullfilled. Only
when it has finished processing does if fullfill (&lt;code&gt;resolve&lt;/code&gt;) its own lock.
Notice that since code is never executed in parallel, it&amp;#39;s perfectly safe to use
a &amp;quot;global&amp;quot; variable to save the last lock. Each successive callback invocation
creates a copy of the last lock then replaces it with its own. This ensures that
only a single callback may be waiting on a lock, and thus there is no data race:
the callbacks are serialized neatly, each waiting on the previous callback&amp;#39;s
lock to be fullfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;incremental-index-pages&quot;&gt;Incremental Index Pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecturally, the big challenge was how to regen index pages without having
to reprocess every blog post ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem occurs for instance when you add a new post: all the index pages
have to have their post shifted backwards one unit. Reparsing the HTML would
have been a possibility, although I didn&amp;#39;t once contemplate it. It&amp;#39;s still a bit
ugly in my mind as the HTML page is a product, not a source. But it might
actually have worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I ended up doing instead is create a file called &lt;code&gt;posts.json&lt;/code&gt; that
serialized all the needed post data. This includes title, date, layout type, as
well as content for (a) posts that need to appear in the &lt;a href=&quot;/atom.xml&quot;&gt;atom feed&lt;/a&gt; and (b)
posts whose layout is &lt;code&gt;brief&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. posts whose content appears directly on the
index pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also pushed the vice further, and only regenerated the index pages that
actually needed to. For instance, if I removed the very first post, only the
last index page would have to be regenerated. I didn&amp;#39;t push this as hard as I
could have: for instance renaming a post will also cause all subsequent index
pages to be regenerated, when there is really no need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;filesystem-watching-frustrations&quot;&gt;Filesystem Watching Frustrations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only frustrating thing I had to deal with was the filesystem watching
libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was further compounded by a dumb mistake of my own which made my whole
prior evaluation of libraries irrelevant. I don&amp;#39;t even remember what it was I
did, but it caused me to think the libraries were malfunctioning while it was me
that was actually being a dumbass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are the libraries that I considered, and should reconsider at some
point in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar&quot;&gt;Chokidar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/nsfw&quot;&gt;nsfw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atom/watcher&quot;&gt;@atom/watcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/fb-watchman&quot;&gt;fb-watchman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also the built-in &lt;code&gt;fs.watch&lt;/code&gt;, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar&quot;&gt;Chokidar&lt;/a&gt; page reports that it
has a slew of issues, which I am inclined to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going with &lt;code&gt;nsfw&lt;/code&gt; as it was the one I had setup when I finally
understood my mistake. However I cannot recommend it, it works quite shittily,
at the very least on Windows. Amongst the issue I had to contend with and hack
around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duplicate events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File renaming causes a creation event on the old file and a modify event on
the new file (in addition to the renaming event).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File creation also causes a modify event on the created file (in addition to
the creation event).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These may just be &lt;code&gt;fs.watch&lt;/code&gt; issues that &lt;code&gt;nsfw&lt;/code&gt; didn&amp;#39;t guard against though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;nsfw&lt;/code&gt; also has different dependencies for Windows and MacOS, which causes some
trouble for me, as I have my code on Dropbox so that I may seamlessly switch
from my laptop to my desktop without requiring a dirty commit (it&amp;#39;s on Git as
well, don&amp;#39;t worry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that the &lt;code&gt;@atom/watcher&lt;/code&gt; is different from the original &lt;code&gt;watcher&lt;/code&gt; lib,
which doesn&amp;#39;t build anymore. I think the build script is the only thing that has
been altered however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fb-watchman&lt;/code&gt; required an OS-specific software install outside of NPM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tools required some Windows build tools to be installed globally (you
could install it locally, but it&amp;#39;s huge). Another one (or the same, I don&amp;#39;t
remember) required a flag to ask for Python 2.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, this was a bit of a headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to try one of those, my hunch and the above tells me to go with
Chokidar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I&#39;ve Been Up To</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;Been a while! What I&amp;#39;ve been to since July, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/NrzEvTjUMPfdXKwb9&quot;&gt;Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/RpXdMQpQa7beJkL96&quot;&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I improved the program that generates this website, it now does incremental
generation, and I have a post in the works about it (edit: &lt;a href=&quot;/static-generation-incrementally/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started writing my thesis, and got a good headstart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I finished my re-read of the first 13 books of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time&quot;&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/a&gt;, and my first
read of the 14th and final book. (I must have read 3 of them since July.) I
thought of writing about it, but the series means so much to me (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/norswap/status/1032258555846569986&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;m not the
only one&lt;/a&gt;), I&amp;#39;m afraid not to do it justice. I must also recoup my
thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know Amazon is adapting it into a TV show? Might use that as an excuse
to re-read and write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve kept &lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training/&quot;&gt;lifting weights&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#39;ll write some thoughts about it soon (edit:
&lt;a href=&quot;/weight-training-2/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m now reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://eightyearsinazeroth.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;8 Years in Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the account of player Hanzo as he leads
his guild &lt;Descendants of Draenor&gt; through the first eight years of World of
Warcraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve started tracking my sleep using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sleep.urbandroid.org/introducing-sonar-as-sensor/&quot;&gt;sonar tech&lt;/a&gt; of the application
&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&quot;&gt;Sleep as Android&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve used that as an incentive to get my average time in
bed to 8 hours / night over the past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>More Anime I Watched</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;About this time last year, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/&quot;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; giving my opinions
about all the anime series I ever watched (15 of them). One year later, it&amp;#39;s
time to update the list and give you my always-so-important opinions on
everything I watched this year. (And two things I watched before that I actually
forgot to include in the previous post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shows listed in roughly chronological viewing order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;accel-world&quot;&gt;Accel World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried watching Accel World because it is based on light novels by the same
author as the Sword Art Online light novels. It&amp;#39;s not made by the same studio
however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s fair to say I didn&amp;#39;t like it. The graphical style and the universe is nice
enough. But my god this protagonist. He&amp;#39;s the reluctant kind. Think Shinji from
Evangelion, except way way (way) worse — and without the psychological angle,
nor all the other things that make Evangelion a cult classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not recommended unless your tolerance to cringe is high. I dropped it after
about 5-6 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-certain-magical-index&quot;&gt;A Certain Magical Index&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another show from before, another one I dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot didn&amp;#39;t manage to pull me in, or to convince me. Without spoiling, there
is a major event happening early in the series, and it doesn&amp;#39;t work at all
because we haven&amp;#39;t built enough rapport with the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The titular &lt;em&gt;Index&lt;/em&gt; (it&amp;#39;s a character) is almost absent from the show, except as
a poorly exploited plot device. I dropped the show after 5-6 episodes, so maybe
it improves, but I&amp;#39;m not holding out my breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;k-on-&quot;&gt;K-On!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K-On! is a typical &lt;em&gt;slice-of-life&lt;/em&gt; show, about a couple of girls forming a music
club — essentially a rock band — in their high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched it because it&amp;#39;s the favourite show of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/DigibronyMLP/videos&quot;&gt;Digibro&lt;/a&gt;, an anime commentator
I really like despite often disagreeing with him. The show also seemed nice
enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it was, I especially enjoyed the first season. The second one seemed a bit
too long and dragging for me — it&amp;#39;s almost twice as long as the first one. The
show is very contemplative. I think slice-of-life shows might be like that in
general. You have to watch it either like me, curled up in your sofa with a warm
drink, enjoying the fuzzy warm glow without spending too much brain cycles on
the action — or, like Digibro, over-analysing every small detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show is solid though, if those things are for you. I definitely don&amp;#39;t regret
watching it, but I won&amp;#39;t be seeking slice of life shows either. Especially since
this is apparently &lt;em&gt;the best one&lt;/em&gt;. I might &lt;a href=&quot;#a-place-further-than-the-universe&quot;&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; disagree with that
though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;attack-on-titan-season-2&quot;&gt;Attack on Titan Season 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reviewed the first season &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#attack-on-titan&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, but the second season is out, and it
continues to kick ass, hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is different though. The first season focused much on the grimness and sheer
horror of the universe — showing how, in the process, the characters could
become fucked up in the head. The second season, on the other hand, is more
focused on the narrative, within this universe. And despite the fact many people
said they preferred the first season, I think that&amp;#39;s a good thing. I don&amp;#39;t think
repeating the first season would have worked past a certain point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot works, the action (and animation thereof) continues to be the
state-of-the-art for anime shows. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CID-sYQNCew&quot;&gt;music&lt;/a&gt; rocks. It&amp;#39;s just
FUN to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;angel-beats-&quot;&gt;Angel Beats!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few friends told me Angel Beats! was their favourite anime, so I went into it
with high expectations... and was quite let down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show is about a place — a high school, &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; — where young people go
when they die a tragic death, and is focused on the antics of the &lt;em&gt;Afterlife
Battlefront&lt;/em&gt; who fights a super-powered character named Angel, who seems
determined to not let them do whatever they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show has some cute ideas, and it kinda works. I think the ropes are a bit
too thick on this one, and I found the ending particularly offensive on account
of forced sentimentality. But who knows, it might work for you. It&amp;#39;s not bad
anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;overlord&quot;&gt;Overlord&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m officially a sucker for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai&quot;&gt;Isekai&lt;/a&gt;, and so it&amp;#39;s logical I would give Overlord a
shot. The plot is classico-classic: a MMO player gets trapped into the game.
Except this player is almost the most powerful bar none, owns a massive guild
hall that acts as his own personal dungeon, with his own NPC (non-player
characters) lackeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the first season revolves around this protagonist learning about the
world, and having a couple brushes with the NPC geo-politics. Season 2 has a
couple different arcs, some kinda meh (lizard men), some rather good (anything
with Sebas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, while the universe is super intriguing, there is something about the
show that is quite disappointing. It&amp;#39;s a far cry from Log Horizon — a personal
favorite that I reviewed &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#log-horizon&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;. Log Horizon does the world
building much more subtly and intricately. Everything in Overlord is
over-explicated, over-acted, and there is very little of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I&amp;#39;ll probably continue watching if new seasons come out. But this
is not a heartfelt recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;kill-la-kill&quot;&gt;Kill la Kill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kill la Kill is made by the same people who made Gurren Lagann, perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#gurren-lagann&quot;&gt;my
favorite anime&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;d heard plenty of good things about it, and so of
course I was pumped when I started watching it. And I wasn&amp;#39;t let down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Kill la Kill is a bit looser than Gurenn Lagann, it bursts with the same
energy, and it is a joy to watch. It&amp;#39;s full of great ideas, and it&amp;#39;s a technical
masterpiece besides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no point in talking too much about it: just watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#39;d be tempted to think that it&amp;#39;s just goofy anime, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg8S5A7jFX4&quot;&gt;here&amp;#39;s Digibro
 analyzing&lt;/a&gt; the very first scene of the anime and breaking down how
 brilliantly put together it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-hero-academia&quot;&gt;My Hero Academia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Hero Academia is a pure shonen anime. In a universe where most people are
born with a power or another, the show focuses on an elite school for &lt;em&gt;heroes&lt;/em&gt;—
future super-powered crime-fighter that engage similarly powerful villains. What
could be more formulaic than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it works. The show is not about being incredibly original or novel,
it&amp;#39;s all about flawless execution. Just like Attack on Titan, this is a show
that is just an absolute blast to watch. The plot is engaging, the action is
cool, the varieties of powers and characters make some interesting plans and
plots possible, and the characters are credible in their concerns and state of
minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obligatory &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfycWHe1Lg&quot;&gt;analysis video&lt;/a&gt; by Gigguk (contains spoilers!) on
the tournament arc, which really underscores my points — that is (a) that the
show executes really well and (b) that it is something to get hyped about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third season is now airing, and it&amp;#39;s as good as ever, it&amp;#39;s impressive how
steady the show&amp;#39;s quality is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hnS5DAKkz4&quot;&gt;You Say Run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;steins-gate&quot;&gt;Steins;Gate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steins;Gate is this weird show about time-travel. I didn&amp;#39;t really know what to
expect, excepted that it was very highly regarded. In the first few episodes,
you really get this sense of mystery and drama to come, but otherwise it seems
to be just about this group of misfits goofing around pretending to do science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the show goes, it gets darker, and you also get to understand there was more
going on under the surface. I really like that there is a real evolution in the
show, it works its way up, increases the stakes without ever being boring or
out-of-place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an instant favorite, and it comes highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon-&quot;&gt;Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dubiously named anime, more often referred as &lt;em&gt;DanMachi&lt;/em&gt; (an abbreviation
of the Japanese name) is an isekai/harem anime that reminds me very much of
&lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#konosuba-&quot;&gt;Konosuba!&lt;/a&gt;. In a fashion typical of some harem anime, the hero (&lt;em&gt;Bell&lt;/em&gt;) doesn&amp;#39;t
actually do any picking up (more like anti-picking-up). However, the story
manages to be quite interesting, with a few touches of humor here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is probably less humor-focused, and less sharp than Konosuba!.
But despite what people say, Konosuba! never really made me laugh, but rather
made me smile. I&amp;#39;d put Danmachi in exactly the same basket, and I could almost
copy &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#konosuba-&quot;&gt;the Konosuba! review&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a comfortable show for me, and
that&amp;#39;s exactly how I enjoy it. Although it must be said it gets considerably
more epic than Konosuba! ever does towards the end. I&amp;#39;m eager to see if it will
continue on this trend — if we ever get a second season that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-game-no-life&quot;&gt;No Game No Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another show that I heard mentioned repeatedly, and so had to watch.
It&amp;#39;s also sort-of an isekai, although the universe focuses on games whose rules
are imagined by the protagonist and brought to life in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main protagonists (Sora and Shiro) are siblings who are incredibly talented
at games, and are because of this summoned to an alternate universe (Disboard)
by the god Tet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot revolves around Sora and Shiro struggle for power in this world through
high-stakes games. My main criticism here is that, as is often the case, the
outcome of these games feel highly &lt;em&gt;ex machina&lt;/em&gt;. There is no way to predict the
winning actions the characters make with the information we have (or that they
have, for that matter). Like in &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#code-geass&quot;&gt;Code Geass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#death-note&quot;&gt;Death Note&lt;/a&gt;, the supposed
genius of the protagonists feels fake and forced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can get over this, it&amp;#39;s not a bad show though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;citrus&quot;&gt;Citrus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went intro Citrus expecting to find the next representative of the trash anime
genre, after &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/anime/32901/Eromanga-sensei&quot;&gt;Eromanga Sensei&lt;/a&gt; (which I still haven&amp;#39;t watched). Instead, I found
a cute love story. A cute &lt;em&gt;incestuous&lt;/em&gt; lesbian love story, but still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, almost everything is said. Frankly, it&amp;#39;s a cute love story with
girls and that&amp;#39;s it. For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I quite enjoyed it, but I don&amp;#39;t really
have a reference frame here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-place-further-than-the-universe&quot;&gt;A Place Further Than The Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This anime is about four girls striving to achieve a common goal: going to
Antartica, and — spoiler alert (not) — their journey there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not exactly sure what this is — slice-of-life? — but who cares? The
point is that it is tremendously cute, touching and inspiring. There is a sense
of youthful possibilities and optimism that permeates the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show has been critically very well received (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGsvHRyiTG0&quot;&gt;exhibit a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO6CGqKimC0&quot;&gt;exhibit b&lt;/a&gt;), I
think with good reason. As a mentionned earlier, I&amp;#39;m not too experienced with
this kind of anime, but I think this is what it should strive to be: something
touching but not mushy, cute but not brainless, optimistic but not naive. It
think it does well while definitely remaining in the light tone of the genre. No
darkness will be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJeOoMkXTFw&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt;, doesn&amp;#39;t it just sound like optimism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;death-note&quot;&gt;Death Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death Note is a huge classic. It&amp;#39;s currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php?type=bypopularity&quot;&gt;#1 in popularity&lt;/a&gt; on
my anime list. And to be sure, it is enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buuut, my criticism of it is almost exactly the same as for &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#code-geass&quot;&gt;Code Geass&lt;/a&gt;. Both
shows are actually very close. In both of them an anti-hero lead character tries
to assume dominion of the world through 3D mental chess, helped by a handy
super-power. In this case the power is the nominal &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt; — a notebook in
which writing people&amp;#39;s name kills them. Same criticism then, which is that plot
development is &lt;em&gt;ex machina&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s not a fair playing field: characters in the
show knows what the writer knows, but you don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once again, aside from that, it&amp;#39;s a solid show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard multiple people say that the second part is less good than the first,
but I didn&amp;#39;t feel this way, feeling the quality to be more or less constant. It
is true that a big event happening around halfway through is a big letdown
however. I found the ending to be relatively satisfying, if not exempt from the
series&amp;#39; overall sins. Let&amp;#39;s just say that it didn&amp;#39;t feel inevitable at all,
given what was previously shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;grimgar-of-fantasy-and-ash&quot;&gt;Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s another Isekai. But what an Isekai!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protagonists are trapped inside a game — or an alternative reality, we don&amp;#39;t
really know — and lost their memory. So they get to work, painstakingly trying
to kill some measly goblins to sustain their continued existance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show starts cute and slightly goofy, but soon things take a more dark turn.
It&amp;#39;s consistently poetic and thoughtful however. I like how the subtleties of
the characters&amp;#39; personalities are explored through the prism of the inner
monologue of the main character (Haruhiro).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve picked up my tastes a bit, you understand there is no way I could not
love this show. And indeed, it&amp;#39;s an instant favorite and I&amp;#39;m desperately hoping
for a sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sword-art-online-alternative-gun-gale-online&quot;&gt;Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;/every-anime/#sword-art-online&quot;&gt;Sword Art Online&lt;/a&gt; spin-off set within the &lt;em&gt;Gun Gale
Online&lt;/em&gt; game (from SAO season 2). There is no Kirito, Asuna &amp;amp; co, but it&amp;#39;s stil
quintessentially Sword Art Online: an event in an online game (a tournament) has
spillovers causing danger in real life. Hand-wavy but fun fights are also par
for the course. There&amp;#39;s even an Eir Aoi theme song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing truly original or marvelous in GGO, but if you like Sword Art
Online, you will find it enjoyable. For me, it&amp;#39;s a comfy show.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>12 Rules For Life</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &lt;em&gt;12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_Rules_for_Life&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;)
by Jordan Peterson. I found it to be a very inspiring read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed the book is more about inspiring than delivering insights. But that&amp;#39;s
fine, often motivation is 90% of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peterson does more than deliver advice though, he outlines a veritable life
philosophy, revolving around the idea of developing character in the face of
suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of life has more to do with developing character in the face of
suffering thant with happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He preaches a philosophy of gradual self-improvement, not to reach some kind of
awesome success, but to make life more palatable for you and others, and he
suggests that if everyone where to do this, we really could have heaven on
earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like his grandiose style, although it sometimes rambles. But somehow the
rambling works and the side alleys Peterson wanders into never fail to be
interesting. There are some take-aways in the book that have only little to do
with the main message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of all of this, the book is relatively hard to summarize, and if it
seems interesting to you, I&amp;#39;d highly suggest you to read it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t sure how to best summarize the lessons of the book in a way that would
be useful to me or others. In the end, I chose to simply include my favorite
quotes from each chapter/rule — usually a motivational tidbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-stand-up-straight-with-your-shoulders-back&quot;&gt;1. Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an unspeakably primordial calculator, deep within you, at the very
foundation of your brain, far below your thoughts and feelings. It monitors
exactly where you are positioned in society. If you&amp;#39;re low, you&amp;#39;ll be stressed
and in constant alert. If you&amp;#39;re high you&amp;#39;ll stand confident and calm
(serotonin will flow), and see chance as opportunity rather than risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible
responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily
transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. It
means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the
end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are
only dimly comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices
necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality (it means acting to
please God, in the ancient language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-treat-yourself-like-someone-you-are-responsible-for-helping&quot;&gt;2. Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible For Helping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To straddle that fundamental duality is to be balanced: to have one foot
firmly planted in order and security, and the other in chaos, possibility,
growth and adventure. When life suddenly reveals itself as intense, gripping
and meaningful; when time passes and you’re so engrossed in what you’re doing
you don’t notice — it is there and then that you are located precisely on the
border between order and chaos. You are there when — and where — it matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Heaven is something you must build, and immortality something you must
earn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself,
so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel. You have to articulate
your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking
inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you
work and play. You must discipline yourself carefully. You must keep the
promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and
motivate yourself. You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that
you are most likely to become and to stay a good person. It would be good to
make the world a better place. Heaven, after all, will not arrive of its own
accord. We will have to work to bring it about, and strengthen ourselves, so
that we can withstand the deadly angels and flaming sword of judgment that God
used to bar its entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-make-friends-with-people-who-want-the-best-for-you&quot;&gt;3. Make Friends With People Who Want The Best For You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When well-meaning counsellors place a delinquent teen among comparatively
civilized peers, the delinquency spreads, not the stability. Down is a lot
easier than up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that your contempt would be more salutary than your pity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you help someone, you should find out why that person is in trouble.
You shouldn’t merely assume that he or she is a noble victim of unjust
circumstances and exploitation. It’s the most unlikely explanation, not the
most probable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, if you buy the story that everything terrible just happened on its
own, with no personal responsibility on the part of the victim, you deny that
person all agency in the past (and, by implication, in the present and future,
as well). In this manner, you strip him or her of all power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success: that’s the mystery. Virtue: that’s what’s inexplicable. To fail, you
merely have to cultivate a few bad habits. You just have to bide your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s something to consider: If you have a friend whose friendship you
wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you
have such a friend for yourself? You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty
is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and
honestly. Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement. You are not morally obliged
to support someone who is making the world a worse place. Quite the opposite.
You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good
thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you. It’s
appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be
improved if they saw your life improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-compare-yourself-to-who-you-were-yesterday-not-to-who-someone-else-is-today&quot;&gt;4. Compare Yourself To Who You Were Yesterday, Not To Who Someone Else Is Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the direction of your sight changes. You see past the limitations that
hemmed you in, unknowingly. New possibilities for your life emerge, and you
work toward their realization. Your life indeed improves. And then you start
to think, further: “Better? Perhaps that means better for me, and my family,
and my friends — even for my enemies. But that’s not all it means. It means
better today, in a manner that makes everything better tomorrow, and next
week, and next year, and a decade from now, and a hundred years from now. And
a thousand years from now. And forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You decide to act as if existence might be justified by its goodness — if only
you behaved properly. And it is that decision, that declaration of existential
faith, that allows you to overcome nihilism, and resentment, and arrogance. It
is that declaration of faith that keeps hatred of Being, with all its
attendant evils, at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith is the realization that the tragic irrationalities of life must be
counterbalanced by an equally irrational commitment to the essential goodness
of Being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sermon on the Mount outlines the true nature of man, and the proper aim of
mankind: concentrate on the day, so that you can live in the present, and
attend completely and properly to what is right in front of you — but do that
only after you have decided to let what is within shine forth, so that it can
justify Being and illuminate the world. Do that only after you have determined
to sacrifice whatever it is that must be sacrificed so that you can pursue the
highest good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-do-not-let-your-children-do-anything-that-makes-you-dislike-them&quot;&gt;5. Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Makes You Dislike Them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norswap: I found this chapter fascinating, because it discusses a matter
(disciplining children) to which I had never given, and gives compelling answers
that are somewhat against the current doxa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children cannot be left to their device. They need to be protected, and they
need to be socialized. Failure to properly discipline your child will make him
unable to socialize and hurt him a lot in the long run. Such children are
unfocused, craving for attention and affection, and that turns people off a lot,
despite what they pretend. A kid that did not learn to share, she will be
rejected by children and adults alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents must be a proxy for society, teaching their children what is expected of
them, what is allowable and what is not. Their proper socialization and future
success depends on it. Parents are &lt;em&gt;responsible&lt;/em&gt; for disciplining their
children. If you don&amp;#39;t do it, the world will do it, in a more harsher and
uncaring way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tentative rules on how to discipline children:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit the rules. Bad laws drive out respect for the good laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suggestions: Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence. Do not torture
and bully other children, so you don’t end up in jail. Eat in a civilized and
thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and
pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay
attention when spoken to by adults, so they don’t hate you and might
therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably,
so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence.
Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because
you’re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening,
so that you’re invited for the fun. Act so that other people are happy you’re
around, so that people will want you around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the least force necessary to enforce those rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do parenting in pairs. So that the other parent can step in when the first
one slips, and that discussion can be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand your own capacity to be harsh, vengeful, arrogant, resentful,
angry and deceitful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Act as a (caring) proxy for the real world. This will provide the child with
opportunity, self-regard and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-set-your-house-in-perfect-order-before-you-criticize-the-world&quot;&gt;6. Set Your House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If natural disasters are acts of god, then failure to prepare is sin. Hebrews
blamed themselves when they fell, for not heeding god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clean up your own life. Relentlessly seek out opportunities for improvement, and
take them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop doing the things you know to be wrong. Trust your soul&amp;#39;s judgement, don&amp;#39;t
question needlessly. Questions can confuse without enlightening. You don&amp;#39;t need
an external code, although there might be reach teachings there too. Stop
blaming others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-pursue-what-is-meaningful-not-what-is-expedient-&quot;&gt;7. Pursue What Is Meaningful (Not What is Expedient)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of sacrifice: the proposition that something of greater value might be
achieved by giving something up in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the world you are seeing is not the world you want, therefore, it’s time to
examine your values. It’s time to rid yourself of your current
presuppositions. It’s time to let go. It might even be time to sacrifice what
you love best, so that you can become who you might become, instead of staying
who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Jung: No tree can grow to Heaven, unless its roots reach down to Hell.
There is no movement upward without corresponding movement down. You have to
go to the very bottom to meet the devil, the source of your most wicked
thoughts. Only then is enlightenment possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make that an axiom: to the best of my ability I will act in a manner that leads
to the alleviation of unnecessary pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expedience — that’s hiding all the skeletons in the closet. That’s covering
the blood you just spilled with a carpet. That’s avoiding responsibility. It’s
cowardly, and shallow, and wrong. It’s wrong because expedience merely
transfers the curse on your head to someone else, or to your future self, in a
manner that will make your future, and the future generally, worse instead of
better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-tell-the-truth-or-at-least-don-t-lie&quot;&gt;8. Tell The Truth - Or, At Least, Don&amp;#39;t Lie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you say no to your boss, or your spouse, or your mother, when it needs to be
said, then you transform yourself into someone who can say no when it needs to
be said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you betray yourself, if you say untrue things, if you act out a lie, you
weaken your character. If you have a weak character, then adversity will mow you
down when it appears, as it will, inevitably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did what I want happen? No. Then my aim or my methods were wrong. I still have
something to learn.” That is the voice of authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did what I want happen? No. Then the world is unfair. People are jealous, and
too stupid to understand. It is the fault of something or someone else.” That
is the voice of inauthenticity. It is not too far from there to “they should
be stopped” or “they must be hurt” or “they must be destroyed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set your ambitions, even if you are uncertain about what they should be. The
better ambitions have to do with the development of character and ability,
rather than status and power. Status you can lose. You carry character with
you wherever you go, and it allows you to prevail against adversity. Knowing
this, tie a rope to a boulder. Pick up the great stone, heave it in front of
you, and pull yourself towards it. Watch and observe while you move forward.
Articulate your experience as clearly and carefully to yourself and others as
you possibly can. In this manner, you will learn to proceed more effectively
and efficiently towards your goal. And, while you are doing this, do not lie.
Especially to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apprehend your personal truth. Communicate it carefully, in an articulate
manner, to yourself and others. This will ensure your security and your life
more abundantly now, while you inhabit the structure of your current beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your life is not what it could be, try telling the truth. If you cling
desperately to an ideology, or wallow in nihilism, try telling the truth. If
you feel weak and rejected, and desperate, and confused, try telling the
truth. In Paradise, everyone speaks the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-assume-that-the-person-you-are-listening-to-might-know-something-you-don-t&quot;&gt;9. Assume That The Person You Are Listening To Might Know Something You Don&amp;#39;t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great majority of us cannot listen; we find ourselves compelled to evaluate,
because listening is too dangerous. The first requirement is courage, and we do
not always have it. (Carl Rogers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarize the other person&amp;#39;s point (to his satisfaction) in order to understand
him better and to not make an argument against a strawman. It also consolidates
memory, articulation of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it takes a long time to figure out what someone genuinely means when
they are talking. This is because often they are articulating their ideas for
the first time. They can’t do it without wandering down blind alleys or making
contradictory or even nonsensical claims. This is partly because talking (and
thinking) is often more about forgetting than about remembering. To discuss an
event, particularly something emotional, like a death or serious illness, is
to slowly choose what to leave behind. To begin, however, much that is not
necessary must be put into words. The emotion-laden speaker must recount the
whole experience, in detail. Only then can the central narrative, cause and
consequence, come into focus or consolidate itself. Only then can the moral of
the story be derived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you listen, instead, without premature judgment, people will generally tell
you everything they are thinking — and with very little deceit. People will
tell you the most amazing, absurd, interesting things. Very few of your
conversations will be boring. (You can in fact tell whether or not you are
actually listening in this manner. If the conversation is boring, you probably
aren’t.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-be-precise-in-your-speech&quot;&gt;10. Be Precise In Your Speech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t ever underestimate the destructive power of sins of omission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you truly think it is a good idea to retreat, to abandon the possibility of
arming yourself against the rising sea of troubles, and to thereby diminish
yourself in your own eyes? Do you truly think it wise to let the catastrophe
grow in the shadows, while you shrink and decrease and become ever more
afraid? Isn’t it better to prepare, to sharpen your sword, to peer into the
darkness, and then to beard the lion in its den? Maybe you’ll get hurt.
Probably you’ll get hurt. Life, after all, is suffering. But maybe the wound
won’t be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why refuse to specify, when specifying the problem would enable its solution?
Because to specify the problem is to admit that it exists. Because to specify
the problem is to allow yourself to know what you want, say, from friend or
lover — and then you will know, precisely and cleanly, when you don’t get it,
and that will hurt, sharply and specifically. But you will learn something
from that, and use what you learn in the future—and the alternative to that
single sharp pain is the dull ache of continued hopelessness and vague failure
and the sense that time, precious time, is slipping by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why refuse to specify? Because while you are failing to define success (and
thereby rendering it impossible) you are also refusing to define failure, to
yourself, so that if and when you fail you won’t notice, and it won’t hurt.
But that won’t work! You cannot be fooled so easily. You will instead carry
with you a continual sense of disappointment in your own Being and the
self-contempt that comes along with that and the increasing hatred for the
world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say what you mean, so that you can find out what you mean. Act out what you
say, so you can find out what happens. Then pay attention. Note your errors.
Articulate them. Strive to correct them. That is how you discover the meaning
of your life. That will protect you from the tragedy of your life. How could
it be otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confront the chaos of Being. Take aim against a sea of troubles. Specify your
destination, and chart your course. Admit to what you want. Tell those around
you who you are. Narrow, and gaze attentively, and move forward, forthrightly.
Be precise in your speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is tense, it&amp;#39;s essentially Peterson&amp;#39;s charge against the SJW ideology.
Very interesting, but you should just read it. I&amp;#39;ll just try to extract the
insights that are useful in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jung: If you cannot understand why someone did something, look at the
consequences — and infer the motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not always the appropriate tool, but it can prove useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone claims to be acting from the highest principles, for the good of
others, there is no reason to assume that the person’s motives are genuine.
People motivated to make things better usually aren’t concerned with changing
other people — or, if they are, they take responsibility for making the same
changes to themselves (and first).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest we forget: ideas have consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can be resentful because you&amp;#39;re being taken advantage of (or allow
yourself to) or because of whiny refusal to grow up. If it&amp;#39;s not the latter,
you have an obligation to speak up for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men enforce a code of behaviour on each other, when working together. Do your
work. Pull your weight. Stay awake and pay attention. Don’t whine or be
touchy. Stand up for your friends. Don’t suck up and don’t snitch. Don’t be a
slave to stupid rules. Don’t, in the immortal words of Arnold Schwarzenegger,
be a girlie man. Don’t be dependent. At all. Ever. Period. The harassment that
is part of acceptance on a working crew is a test: are you tough,
entertaining, competent and reliable? If not, go away. Simple as that. We
don’t need to feel sorry for you. We don’t want to put up with your
narcissism, and we don’t want to do your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When softness and harmlessness become the only consciously acceptable virtues,
then hardness and dominance will start to exert an unconscious fascination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something supersedes thinking, despite its truly awesome power. When existence
reveals itself as existentially intolerable, thinking collapses in on itself.
In such situations — in the depths — it’s noticing, not thinking, that does
the trick. Perhaps you might start by noticing this: when you love someone,
it’s not despite their limitations. It’s because of their limitations. Of
course, it’s complicated. You don’t have to be in love with every shortcoming,
and merely accept. You shouldn’t stop trying to make life better, or let
suffering just be. But there appear to be limits on the path to improvement
beyond which we might not want to go, lest we sacrifice our humanity itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a conscious act of courage. Aim up, wish upon a star, then act in
accordance with that aim. Once you are aligned with the heavens, you can
concentrate on the day. Be careful. Put the things you can control in order.
Repair what is in disorder, and make what is already good better. It is
possible that you can manage, if you are careful. People are very tough.
People can survive through much pain and loss. But to persevere they must see
the good in Being. If they lose that, they are truly lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you call her — sometimes of her own accord — Ginger will trot
across the street, tail held high, with a little kink at the end. Then she
will roll on her back in front of Sikko, who wags his tail happily as a
consequence. Afterward, if she feels like it, she might come visit you, for a
half a minute. It’s a nice break. It’s a little extra light, on a good day,
and a tiny respite, on a bad day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pay careful attention, even on a bad day, you may be fortunate enough
to be confronted with small opportunities of just that sort. Maybe you will
see a little girl dancing on the street because she is all dressed up in a
ballet costume. Maybe you will have a particularly good cup of coffee in a
café that cares about their customers. Maybe you can steal ten or twenty
minutes to do some little ridiculous thing that distracts you or reminds you
that you can laugh at the absurdity of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is good sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;coda&quot;&gt;Coda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What shall I do with my life? Aim for Paradise, and concentrate on today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What shall I do with the world? Conduct myself as if Being is more valuable
than Non-Being. Act so that you are not made bitter and corrupt by the tragedy
of existence. confront the uncertainty of the world voluntarily, and with
faith and courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What shall I do when I despise what I have? Remember those who have nothing
and strive to be grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What shall I do when my enemy succeeds? Aim a little higher and be grateful
for the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What shall I do in the next dire moment? Focus my attention on the next right
move. When everything has become chaotic and uncertain, all that remains to
guide you might be the character you constructed, previously, by aiming up and
concentrating on the moment at hand. If you have failed in that, you will fail
in the moment of crisis, and then God help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to make the proper sacrifices, failure to reveal yourself, failure to
live and tell the truth — all that weakens you. In that weakened state, you
will be unable to thrive in the world, and you will be of no benefit to
yourself or to others. You will fail and suffer, stupidly. That will corrupt
your soul. How could it be otherwise? Life is hard enough when it is going
well. But when it’s going badly? And I have learned through painful experience
that nothing is going so badly that it can’t be made worse. This is why Hell
is a bottomless pit. To suffer terribly and to know yourself as the cause:
that is Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What shall I do to strengthen my spirit? Do not tell lies, or do what you
despise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Replacing Guilt</title>
      <description>
&lt;p&gt;I finished reading Nate Soares&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mindingourway.com/guilt/&quot;&gt;Replacing Guilt&lt;/a&gt; series. It&amp;#39;s highly
recommended reading if you periodically find yourself guilty over what you
didn&amp;#39;t do or failed to achieve. Roughly, it&amp;#39;s about excising guilt as an
ineffective motivator, and about installing a strong intrinsic motivation
mechanism in its stead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s well worth reading in full, there are a lot of articles, but all of them
are relatively short and to the point. For myself, I extracted the following
list of insights and directives, in order to remember to apply the lessons in my
life. It&amp;#39;s about what resonated with me, so your own take-away might be quite
different. Read the whole thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the terminology used below might not make sense if you didn&amp;#39;t read the
articles, but most of it is fairly general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guilt doesn&amp;#39;t work as a motivator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Half-ass it with everything you&amp;#39;ve got. Do just enough to reach your goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Succeed, with no wasted motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t fail with abandon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drop your &lt;em&gt;shoulds&lt;/em&gt;, consider the alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider not forcing yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not because you should, but because you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expending willpower is a stopgap, not a solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing yourself won&amp;#39;t work next time if it didn&amp;#39;t work last time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t work yourself ragged. Self-care is a goal too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest in motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ground state is motion - don&amp;#39;t take damage while in motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest is not a reward, it&amp;#39;s part of your activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift guilt from the instance to the pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use science to debug bad behaviour patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a new homonculus, do some original seeing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no default &amp;quot;do nothing&amp;quot; action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t tolerify.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After an outcome, simply locate yourself, don&amp;#39;t compare to your expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek the best actions you can identify at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play to win: don&amp;#39;t stop and &amp;quot;try&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t have excuses as a line of retreat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand your failures is understanding what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; could have done better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume capability in the background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s not about effort or willpower, but focus. The path is the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t bang swords, hit the ennemy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek and actually do the obvious things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare and improve response patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When faced with a problem, don&amp;#39;t flail. Start breaking it down, apply
well-known and brute force approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derive confidence from being well aware of your limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Odds shouldn&amp;#39;t influence your ability to commit. The best plan is still the
best regardless of odds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be reckless: commit yourself fully to the best plan until a better one comes
along.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be defiant: refuse the accept the current state of things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be measures by outcomes, not by how hard you tried.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act to ensure the future is as good as you can make it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
