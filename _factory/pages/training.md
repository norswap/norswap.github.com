I started weight-lifting in 2018, and since then I've been regularly writing
about my training. Here are the posts so far.

- [Starting Weight Training](/weight-training)
- [More Weightlifting Observations](/weight-training-2)
- [One Year of Weightlifting](/weight-training-3)
- [Weight Training: Cut Edition](/weight-training-4)
- [Weight Training 5: Intermediate Build and Looking into RTS](/weight-training-5)
- [Weight Training 6: Training at Home During Quarantine](/weight-training-6)
- [Weight Training 7: All The Lifts, All The Time](/weight-training-7)
- [Weight Training 8: Gains](/weight-training-8)

I'm painfully aware that these posts sometimes get rambly. I've resolved to
write a take-away / advice post at some point. If it's not yet done when you
read this, [shoot me a mail][mail] to motivate me :)
