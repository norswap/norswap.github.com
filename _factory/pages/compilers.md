In 2021, I'm teaching a compiler class at [Universit√© catholique de
Louvain][ucl].

All the course materials are made available online, for anyone interested to
peruse. I'm also happy to [answer] your questions.

- [Slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cMgLvEiaWsyfip8wJXXilVhvM2XDrS-6)

The course's project is to create your own programming language. A few libraries
are supplied to assist in this task:

- [Autumn](https://github.com/norswap/autumn) (parsing)
