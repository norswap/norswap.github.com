**Summary**

- upon proper circumstances, act with decisiveness and conviction
- search/wait for mispriced gambles, where the odds are in your favor
- when one turns out, bet heavily
- or: patience, followed by an agressive conduct

---

**Addendum**

The above seems to imply big make-or-break decisions. In reality, while the bets
should be few and far between, there should be enough of them to balance the
potential losses.
