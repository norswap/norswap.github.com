During this past month, I had a lot of fun with [1729.com](https://1729.com), a
newsletter that pays its members in Bitcoins for performing tasks — which are
typically interesting and will teach you something useful.

Here's the main things I did so far:
- [Worked out](https://1729.com/proof-of-workout/) (didn't need them for that,
  but it was nice getting 10$ for it!)
- [Learned some Elixir](https://1729.com/learn-basic-elixir-with-exercism/)
- [Wrote a task for the newsletter to
  reuse](https://1729.com/decentralized-task-creation/) — [here's my
  task](https://ghost.norswap.com/paving-the-titans-way/). The useful thing in
  this one was actually to setup [cloudron](https://www.cloudron.io/) on [the
  oracle cloud](https://www.oracle.com/be/cloud/) (not shilling this because I'm
  an Oracle employeed, but because I'm cheap and it's the only one that has a
  permanent free tier). Cloudron is a cool service manager that lets you install
  a bunch of server apps (including the [ghost](https://ghost.org/) blog
  platform). Don't worry, I still like my [homegrown website
  generator](https://github.com/norswap/norswap.github.io/tree/master/_factory)
  better :)
- [Cold-emailed some rich people to ask for
  money](https://1729.com/refer-task-sponsors/) — not something I'd normally
  feel very comfortable doing.
- [Wrote an article expanding on the idea of building a new digital-first
  country](https://1729.com/how-to-start-a-new-country/) — [here's my
  article](https://ghost.norswap.com/new-country/). I must admit I feel a bit
  shy about this one, because it's such an optimistic view — which is not really
  my usual personality. But that's also why it was a useful exercise to get into
  a different perspective. It did get me thinking about blockchain technologies
  and their potential — expect a more nuanced article on that soon.
- [Learned about quantum
  computing](https://1729.com/quantum-computing-and-proof-of-memory/)
- [Made a video meme about India's crypto
  ban](https://1729.com/video-memes-on-indian-crypto/) — I went for the [Hitler
  reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ecnei9vtLyU) classic

My submissions got selected on some of these tasks and I got ~220$ out of those
that have been awarded so far. That's less that I could have earned otherwise in
the same timespan if I was hell-bent on earning money. But as we'll see below,
that's not why I did it.

There are now new tasks to learn about crypto technologies (the [Ethereum Name
Service](https://ens.domains/) and [learning the solidity smart contract
langauge](https://1729.com/learn-solidity-with-cryptozombies/). I'm excited to
do these too.

But I'm actually not writing this to shill 1729. Rather, it's to marvel about
the power of incentives.

See — most of these things I enjoyed doing and might have done without the
possibility of a monetary compensation. But living is prioritizing (if you're
doing it right at least) and besides working out, none of these things were
high-priority enough.

But 1729 offered me a collection of incentives to complete the tasks:
- I may earn some money!
- There's a deadline.
- I've attempted all tasks so far, so I'm strongly motivated to attempt new
  tasks, for the sake of completion (gamification!)
- These tasks have generally taught me something, or reinforced some good habit
  or useful behaviour.
- The tasks have been devised to be doable in a reasonable timeframe — no need
  to worry about biting off more than one can chew.

To be fair, there was a reason that most of these things were not on my todo
list. But the added incentives were enough to put them past the hump. And the
way I use my time is far from optimal. Had I not, say, written an article, I
might have watched an interesting youtube video instead with no relevance to my
daily life. The incentives stir you towards spending your time smarter.

It also got me thinking. If 1729 can incentivize me in this way, can't I do the
same to me? I can certainly chunk task in manageable bits, and set deadlines. I
can also use [the seinfeld
method](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy) and build
on top of a series of small wins. Paying yourself gets more tricky, however. I
think I know how to make it work.

The key is that I'm cheap. So there are a few not-so-unresonable expenses that I
don't make because they are not strictly necessary or an improvement to my
day-to-day life. Now say there's something I want to get done, or a behaviour I
want to promote. If I care enough about that, I can justify paying to speed it
up. On the other end, I get the reward if I complete the task within the
deadline. It's a smart way to get in alignment with yourself.

There's a snag though — what if you don't make the deadline? Do you just put the
reward back in play? As the payer this makes sense — you want the thing done
after all. But on the other end, this is the wrong lesson: you can slip the
deadline but still get the reward (albeit later). I think the key here is to
reward yourself for consistency. So if you slip, the previous reward might be
out of play for the next task, which will grant a smaller (or more generic)
reward. But if you succeed at that one, *and* at the next one, then you get the
original reward. That way, you get the nice rewards only if you keep succeeding
consistently.

I will try to experiment with these micro-incentive structures in the near
future.
