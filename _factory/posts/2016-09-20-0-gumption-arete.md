This post will talk about two notions that Pirsig puts forward: *gumption* and
*areté*. Gumption is originally a Scottish term, meaning "common sense,
shrewdness", but also "drive, initiative".

Gumption-filling occurs when one is quiet long enough to see, hear and feel the
real universe, not just one's own stale opinions about it.

It's common in people returning from long fishing trips. They seemingly have put
a lot of time for nothing, but in reality they come back with an abundance of
gumption, usually for the very same things they were sick to death of a few
weeks before. It's not wasted time.

"Gumption is the psychic gasoline that keeps the whole thing going." It is
necessary to all psychic tasks of interest. If you don't have it, you might as
well not start. Similarly, its level must be monitored at all times.

When gumption loss occur: take a long break, don't rush in to make up for lost
gumption.

One of the gumption *traps* is ego:

*Areté* is a greek notion that refers to excellence, acquired not as a duty to
others but to oneself.

Areté implies excelling in many domains in life, a respect for the wholeness of
one's life. It implies contempt for efficiency, or rather a higher idea for
efficiency, an efficiency which exists not in one department of life but in life
itself.
