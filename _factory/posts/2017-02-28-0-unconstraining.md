> When you first start learning, early in life, there is a bottleneck in the

> because you are open and there is relatively little to absorb.

> But very quickly, in elementary school, your access to information stops being
> the limiting factor. You take home a few giant textbooks, and suddenly the
> bottleneck moves to ways of structuring and contextualizing the information.

> In high school, you learn a variety of methods to structure
> information — outlines, diagrams, underlining and highlighting, reports, essays,
> notebooks and binders. The bottleneck moves to your ability to synthesize this
> information, to turn it into new ideas.

> In college, if you make it that far, the bottleneck moves to insight generation.
> You start questioning the world as given, and find that the juiciest
> intellectual rewards are ideas that shift how you view it. You start hunting for
> the revolutionary, the controversial, steering your learning toward the red
> pills of paradoxes and contradictions.

> If you are lucky enough to go beyond this, the bottleneck moves once again: to
> your assumptions. They constrain your view, what you are allowed to see, and
> thereby the thoughts and actions available to you. You start getting a kick out
> of unearthing new assumptions, shining a light on blindspots that, by
> definition, you didn’t know you didn’t know about. This process is unbounded,
> because with enough examination, all your beliefs are revealed to be
> assumptions.

> There are many ways to reveal assumptions. Interesting experiences, traveling,
> genuine conversation, and reading fiction all help you question your own point
> of view.
