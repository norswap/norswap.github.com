title: "Getting Youtube Transcripts"
---

Here's a neat trick I just found out about: You can [request the transcript] of a
YouTube video that has captions by going to More > Transcript.

Reading the transcript is often a nice alternative to sitting through a video of
someone talking, even in x2.

Unfortunately, it's still impossible to request automatic captionning for videos
where the author didn't enable it. I wish they'd change that.
