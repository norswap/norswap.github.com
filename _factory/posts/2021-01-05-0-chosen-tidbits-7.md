[You Can't Tell People Anything](http://habitatchronicles.com/2004/04/you-cant-tell-people-anything/)

> What’s going on is that without some kind of direct experience to use as a
> touchstone, people don’t have the context that gives them a place in their
> minds to put the things you are telling them.

> The things you say often don't stick, and the few things that do stick are often
> distorted.

> Also, most people aren't very good at visualizaing hypothetitcals, at imagining
> what something they haven't experienced might be like if it were somewhat
> different.

Drawing might help.

> If you create things that you can keep on the market at a very low cost
> (including your time), you almost cannot fail. Worst case scenario is a slow
> success.
>
> When your running costs are high, time becomes your enemy. Your profits must
> beat the clock, or you go bust.
>
> When your running costs are negligible, time becomes your friend. You cannot go
> bust, and the passage of time exposes you to luck 24/7.

[The Asshole Filter](http://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1209794.html)

> If you find yourself wondering, or just feeling, "Why is everyone I wind up
> dealing with an asshole?" you might want to consider the possibility that you
> have set up an asshole filter. Asshole filters are an extremely common
> phenomenon, and an extremely common problem.

> An asshole filter happens when you publicly promulgate a straitened contact
> boundary and then don't enforce it; or worse, reward the people who transgress
> it.

Example: promulgate that mails mails must go through team mail, but still answer
your private emails or even *expedite* the requests your receive there, thereby
rewarding transgressors.

[Kelly Bet on Everything](https://putanumonit.com/2020/07/04/kelly-bet-on-everything/)

> I wrote this post because of my endless frustration with my friends who have
> the most slack in life also being the most risk averse. They have plenty of
> savings but stay in soul-sucking jobs for years. They complain about the
> monotony of social life but refuse to instigate a change. They don’t travel,
> don’t do drugs, don’t pick fights, don’t flirt, don’t express themselves. They
> don’t want to think about kids because their lives are just so comfortable and
> why would you mess with that?

[The Silence is Deafening](https://devonzuegel.com/post/the-silence-is-deafening)

> When Angry Alice tweets something obnoxious or unproductive, reasonable people
> just scroll past it. If Alice develops a pattern of bad behavior, reasonable
> people will just unfollow, mute, or block her. The result is that it's hard for
> Alice to notice the silent majority of people who saw the trash fire and walked
> away when they recognized that engaging would only fuel its flames.
>
> It gets worse—Angry Alice only sees feedback from extremists, so she doesn't
> receive more nuanced signals that might actually cause her to reflect on her
> behavior. If no reasonable people give feedback, only the unreasonable people
> are left. From Alice's perspective, the only people who disagree with her are
> jerks.
>
> This is a coordination problem. Reasonable people understand that if they join
> the fray alone, they'll most likely be drowned out by the yelling, or worse
> they'll get dragged deeper into it. As a result, they choose stay out of it.
>
> A huge part of the problem is that digital spaces generally have no equivalent
> of a disapproving glare. You're stuck choosing between staying silent and
> entering the fray, with few options in between. If you have little reason to
> believe that other reasonable people will back you up, you're going to stick
> with the default: silence.

[Tolerance is Not A Moral Precept](https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376)

- Tolerance is not a moral precept, it's a peace treaty (or at least non-agression).
- One can't tolerate the intolerant, that would be a suicide pact.

[lisatomic5 on Children's Rights](https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1280903954872676352)

This thread illustrates that telling your children the functional lie that they
have bodily autonomy is exhausting to stick to.

[Fuck Victimhood Identity](https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1281406459855634437)

> The reality is that long ago I noticed that the less I saw and presented
> myself as a victim, the less I was victimized. This kicked off a virtuous
> cycle that I’m not going to jeopardize. Now my life is much improved, and I’ve
> developed a very strong allergy to victim identity.
>
> The spiral of victim identity is incredibly seductive. Once you step in it
> your identity will be reinforced by everyone around you and your own
> confirmation bias. I’ve seen this spiral claim people, groups, nations. It
> didn’t make them better off, and it didn’t make them better.
>
> Victimhood blinds you to the suffering of others. My dating life improved when
> I stopped thinking about how women malign me and became able to understand
> their own fears and frustrations with guys. Before, I literally couldn’t
> fathom that dating can be hard for hot young women
>
> Victimhood blinds you to your own mistakes, the only part you can change.

> Everyone wants their suffering validated, but you will never get this
> validation from those who hurt you if that’s what you seek. If you let go of
> this doomed desire, you may eventually find the validation you crave among
> friends.

---

> You shouldn’t have to argue about *how* you’re fighting, *while* you’re fighting.
>
> Trying to do both at once is a quick way to compound your frustration with each
> other and make things worse for everybody.
>
> The smart thing to do is to schedule relationship maintenance in advance.

[How to Understand Things](https://nabeelqu.co/understanding)

> My father has zero intellectual insecurities... It has never crossed his mind
> to be concerned that the world thinks he’s an idiot. He’s not in that game. So
> if he doesn’t understand something, he just asks you. He doesn’t care if he
> sounds foolish. He will ask the most obvious question without any sort of
> concern about it...

> Most people are not willing to do this — looking stupid takes courage, and
> sometimes it’s easier to just let things slide.
>
> It is striking how many situations I am in where I start asking basic
> questions, feel guilty for slowing the group down, and it turns out that
> nobody understood what was going on to begin with (often people message me
> privately saying that they’re relieved I asked), but I was the only one who
> actually spoke up and asked about it.

[One Week Project Management](https://garybasin.com/one-week-project-management/)

> Starting a big project is tricky. I usually have some sense of what needs to
> be done, but my time estimates tend to be… a little off. There’s one thing
> worse than underestimating the time it’ll take: doing unnecessary work. I hate
> getting traction on a project only to realize that a bunch of work was wasted.
>
> There’s a trick that often works for me: Rescope the project to complete it
> within the next week. Even when unrealistic, trying to apply that tight
> constraint can get you to notice things you wouldn’t otherwise. It forces me
> to consider what is absolutely necessary and what can be skipped. It forces me
> to spend one of my days planning so I know exactly what I need to execute.
>
> [Parkinson’s Law] states that a project takes as much time as you allow it.
> Once in a while, try allowing much less time than you think is necessary.

> My cynical view of humanity at large informs my sympathetic view of actual
> humans. By the standards of horny status-obsessed murder monkeys, even my
> outgroup enemies are often doing the best they can consider the fears and
> insecurities that plague them.
>
> On the other hand, if you believe that humans are by nature benign and kind and
> are only "corrupted" by culture, you will have a very negative view of the
> prevailing culture and most people. This will tempt you to dream of revolutions
> or a return to some golden age.
