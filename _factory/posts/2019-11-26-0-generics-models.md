title: Models of Generics and Metaprogramming Article
---

I recently came accross this page:

[Models of Generics and Metaprogramming: Go, Rust, Swift, D and More][models]

It is in a similar vein as the article I wrote earlier on [polymorphism] (though
probably better written). It's pretty nice, go check it out.

[polymorphism]: /polymorphism
