Learned Optimism is a book by Dr. Martin Seligman.

The book exposes a theory about how people explain things to themselves. We all
do this, it's part of the whole sentience thing we have going on. Something
happens, and we make up a little theory about why it happened.

The explanations you produce are classified along the following axis:

<dl>

  <dt>Personal vs Impersonal</dt>
  
  <dd>Whether the explanation makes you responsible for the thing that happened
  (personal) or not (impersonal).</dd>
  
  <dt>Specific vs General</dt>
  
  <dd>Is the explanation about the thing that happened (specific), or are they
  about you, your beliefs, your methods, ... (general).</dd>
  
  <dt>Temporary vs Permanent</dt>
  
  <dd>Is the thing that happened temporary? Or is it permanent? Did it happen
  just one time, or is it a pattern that will repeat itself?</dd>
  
</dl>

Seligman research showed that explanations differ depending on whether the
explainer is an optimist or a pessimist, and whether the thing that happened is
good or bad.

<dl>
    <dt>Optimists</dt>
    
    <dd>
    <ul>
    <li>Good things are personal, general, and permanent.</li>
    <li>Bad things are impersonal, specific, and temporary.</li>
    </ul>
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Pessimists</dt>
    
    <dd>
    <ul>
    <li>Good things are impersonal, specific, and temporary.</li>
    <li>Bad things are personal, general, and permanent.</li>
    </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

Both optimists are pessimists are inconsistent in their explanations, but in a
different way.

This is a simplified model, and may even seem silly; but if you're like me
(norswap), it's hard not to recognize that you flog yourself over your mistakes
more often than you pat yourself on the back for your achievements.

Seligman says you can train yourself to become an optimist, and this implies
changing the patterns of your explanations. He claims this changes your mood and
your productivity.

It is not controversial to say that our moods affect the explanations we make up
for things that happen in our lives. Explanatory Theory takes it a step further
and says that the explanations we make up for things also affect our moods and
behaviour.

To train yourself to become an optimist:

- You train yourself to make a note of your explanations, every day. Repetition
  and consistency matters.

- You analyze whether your explanations for good things are personal, general,
  and permanent. You analyze whether your explanations for bad things are
  impersonal, specific, and temporary.

- You correct your explanations to make them optimistic. And you track your
  progress, just as you would track your progress for anything else you are
  trying to change in your life.
