[Why I Ignore All Studies](http://tynan.com/ignore)

A p-value of 0.05 means 5% of results are wrong **and** the uninteresting
results go unpublished so in practice it's way more (p-value fishing).

> Last, I lower my confidence in studies because every individual is different.
> That doesn't mean that I should smoke because maybe I'm not affected by
> tobacco, but it does mean that if the average person needs 7 hours of sleep
> but my own research shows that 8 works best for me, I should probably stick to
> 8.

[Planning to Start, Planning to Finish][planning]

[planning]: https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/planning-to-start-planning-to-finish

> Over the years I’ve realized that a different distinction, within planning, is
> probably much more important: between planning to start, and planning to finish.
>
> Planning to finish is the familiar kind, where you plan all the way to the end
> and the terminal condition is the completed state of the activity. The finish
> line, the deadline, the checkered flag.
>
> Planning to start though, is the more important kind for any creative work.
> The French phrase mise en place, a favorite of Hercule Poirot, gets at this.
> It roughly means “setting the stage”, especially with reference to cooking
> preparations.
>
> When you plan to start, you get to the starting line rather than the finishing
> line, by setting the stage for a more creative, improvised phase. You can call
> it getting to the starting line, or as I prefer, by analogy to deadline, the
> lifeline. A condition where a zombie set of parts is assembled together in a
> way that makes it come alive.
>
> The difference relates to what Scott Adams called the difference between
> systems and goals. When you plan to start, you undertake planned activities to
> end in a functioning system where habits can flow.
>
> Another connection familiar to many of you is to James Carse’s notion of
> finite versus infinite games. Planning to finish is playing a finite game to
> win it and exit it. Planning to start is working to enter an infinite game and
> continue playing it.
>
> Whatever you choose to call it, you should probably spend more time thinking
> about this difference than about how much planning to do, which is often a
> much simpler question.

[Speed Matters](http://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters)

> Part of the activation energy required to start any task comes from the
> picture you get in your head when you imagine doing it. It may not be that
> going for a run is actually costly; but if it feels costly, if the picture in
> your head looks like a slog, then you will need a bigger expenditure of will
> to lace up.
>
> Slowness seems to make a special contribution to this picture in our heads.
> Time is especially valuable. So as we learn that a task is slow, an especial
> cost accrues to it. Whenever we think of doing the task again, we see how
> expensive it is, and bail.
>
> That’s why speed matters.

[Eating The Shadow](https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/eating-the-shadow)

> We can embrace our monstrosity while cultivating our human nobility. We can
> allow each to transform the other, so we become cheerful, kind, useful
> monsters who are also overpowering, unpredictable, and dangerous heroes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Reduce Friction](http://tynan.com/reducefriction)

Reduce friction.

Automation might be costly... but it removes friction — it pays for more than
just the effort.

Sometimes not even automatization but making sure you can do stuff in an
optimized way.

[Investing In Your Ordinary Powers][ordinary]

[ordinary]: https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/investing-in-your-ordinary-powers

> The personal growth world is somewhat obsessed with strengths and weaknesses,
> or more generally, things that make you different from others, whether you
> view those things as gifts or curses.

<!-- -->

> To get past a strengths/weaknesses orientation, or more generally past your
> specialness orientation, you have to get in touch with the things that make
> you ordinary.
>
> An early adopter is a classic example of someone investing in their
> ordinariness. There may be some mild strengths or weaknesses involved: maybe you
> are slightly better at figuring out janky UIs (a minor strength), or slightly
> more susceptible to distraction (a minor weakness). But mainly, being an early
> adopter is exactly the same as being a late adopter, except you are early.

<!-- -->

> You may attract a romantic partner through things that make you special, but
> most relationship maintenance skills are based on investing in the ordinary.

[Peter Thiel](https://www.perell.com/blog/peter-thiel)

> “Contrarians may be mostly wrong, but when they get it right, they get it really
> right.”

<!-- -->

> According to Thiel, monopoly is the end state of every successful business. If
> you want to create and capture lasting economic value, don’t compete. The more
> unique companies are, the more the business world can flourish.

[How Much is Your Time Worth?][worth]

[worth]: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/y5RoNDPcfJqm3vfQA/the-value-of-your-time-or-why-you-should-buy-an-ac

A post asking the question (among others): "should you buy an AC unit"?

Interesting perspective.

[Mediocratopia 8][mediocratopia]

[mediocratopia]: https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/09/16/mediocratopia-8/

> Mediocrity is not being a completist about anything. Not finishing for the sake
> of finishing.

<!-- -->

> Mediocrity is not lack of attention to key details, it is to mainly care about
> the key details and being willing to compromise on all other details. This is
> often rational.

<!-- -->

> After a lot of mediocre output, the result can start looking quite good. A bit
> like in the pottery parable - but it's not quite the point. You're not trying
> to cleverly solve for the "best" pot, you just have lower minimum standards
> for pots. You're not throwing away your mediocre pots, which are good enough.

<!-- -->

> For a mediocratist, the level of caring is a design variable, not a fixed
> performance parameter to be set at "maximum" by default.

<!-- -->

> Where you decide to stop caring about what you're doing reveals where you are
> willing to start caring about yourself. And being a completist about
> everything means not caring about yourself at all.
