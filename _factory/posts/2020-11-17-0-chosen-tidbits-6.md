[Some Useful Probability Facts for Systems Programming](https://theartofmachinery.com/2020/01/27/systems_programming_probability.html)

> If an outcome has probability 1/N for each "attempt", and it is attempted N
> times, the probability it will occur at least once stabilizes at 0.62 as N
> increases.

> Suppose you throw N balls randomly (independently and one at a time) into N
> buckets. On average, a bit over a third (1/e) of the buckets will stay empty, a
> bit over a third (1/e again) will have exactly one ball, and the remaining
> quarter or so (1 − 2/e) will contain multiple balls.

> If a group of things are randomly shuffled, a bit of over a third (1/e) of the
> time there’ll be no fixed points (something that lands in the same position), a
> bit of over a third (1/e) of the time there’ll be just one fixed point, and the
> remaining quarter or so of the time there’ll be two or more.

> Let’s look at the common “loot box” mechanism. Specifically, suppose there are
> 10 collector items (say, one for each hero in a franchise) that are sold in
> blind boxes. Let’s take the fairest case in which there are no rare items and
> each item has an equal 1/10 chance of being in a given box. How many boxes will a
> collector buy on average before getting a complete set? This is the called the
> coupon collector’s problem, and for 10 items the answer is about 29.
>
> The answer to the coupon collector’s problem is a bit more than N * ln(N) (add N/2
> for some more accuracy).
>
> The coupon collector’s problem hints at why the loot box mechanism is so
> powerful. The N balls in N buckets rule tells us that the collector will have
> about two thirds of the items after buying 10 boxes. It feels like the collector
> is most of the way there, and it would be a shame to give up and let so much
> progress go to waste, but actually 10 boxes is only about a third of the
> expected number of boxes needed.

[40 powerful concepts for understanding the world](https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1225561131122597896?s=09)

> Ergodicity: A die rolled 100 times has equal probabilities to 100 dice rolled
> once; rolling a die is “ergodic”. But if the die gets chipped after 10 throws
> so it’s likelier to roll 4, then 1 die 100 times =/= 100 dice once
> (non-ergodic). Many treat non-ergodic systems as ergodic.

See [another good explanation](https://larspsyll.wordpress.com/2016/11/23/what-is-ergodicity-2/).

> Simpson’s Paradox: A trend can appear in groups of data but disappear when these
> groups are combined. This effect can easily be exploited by limiting a dataset
> so that it shows exactly what one wants it to show. Thus: beware of even the
> strongest correlations. ([illustration](https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1225561191470260227))

> Condorcet Paradox: a special instance of Simpson’s paradox applied to elections,
> in which a populace prefers candidate A to candidate B, candidate B to C, and
> yet candidate C to A. This occurs because the majority that favors C is
> misleadingly divided among different groups.

> Concept Creep: As a social issue such as racism or sexual harassment becomes
> rarer, people react by expanding their definition of it, creating the illusion
> that the issue is actually getting worse.

> Streetlight Effect: People tend to get their information from where it’s easiest
> to look.

> Woozle Effect: An article makes a claim without evidence, is then cited by
> another, which is cited by another, and so on, until the range of citations
> creates the impression that the claim has evidence, when really all articles are
> citing the same uncorroborated source.

> Tocqueville Paradox: As the living standards in a society rise, the people’s
> expectations of the society rise with it. The rise in expectations eventually
> surpasses the rise in living standards, inevitably resulting in disaffection
> (and sometimes populist uprisings).

> Nirvana Fallacy: When people reject a thing because it compares unfavorably to
> an ideal that in reality is unattainable. E.g. condemning capitalism due to
> the superiority of imagined socialism, condemning ruthlessness in war due to
> imagining humane (but unrealistic) ways to win.

[Concept: Kayfabe](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11783)

> Because professional wrestling is a simulated sport, all competitors who face
> each other in the ring are actually close collaborators who must form a closed
> system (called "a promotion") sealed against outsiders. With external
> competitors generally excluded, antagonists are chosen from within the promotion
> and their ritualized battles are largely negotiated, choreographed, and
> rehearsed at a significantly decreased risk of injury or death. With outcomes
> predetermined under Kayfabe, betrayal in wrestling comes not from engaging in
> unsportsmanlike conduct, but by the surprise appearance of actual sporting
> behavior. Such unwelcome sportsmanship which "breaks Kayfabe" is called
> "shooting" to distinguish it from the expected scripted deception called
> "working".

> [Wrestling evolved out of "catch".] Typical matches could last hours with no
> satisfying action, or end suddenly with crippling injuries to a promising
> athlete in whom much had been invested. This highlighted the close
> relationship between two paradoxical risks which define the category of
> activity which wrestling shares with other human spheres:
>
> A) Occasional but Extreme Peril for the participants.
> B) General: Monotony for both audience and participants.
>
> Kayfabrication (the process of transition from reality towards Kayfabe) arises
> out of attempts to deliver a dependably engaging product for a mass audience
> while removing the unpredictable upheavals that imperil participants. As such
> Kayfabrication is a dependable feature of many of our most important systems
> which share the above two characteristics such as war, finance, love, politics
> and science.

> At the point Kayfabe was forced to own up to the fact that professional
> wrestling contained no sport whatsoever, it did more than avoid being regulated
> and taxed into oblivion. Wrestling discovered the unthinkable: its audience did
> not seem to require even a thin veneer of realism. Professional wrestling had
> come full circle to its honest origins by at last moving the responsibility for
> deception off of the shoulders of the performers and into the willing minds of
> the audience.
>
> Kayfabe, it appears, is a dish best served client-side.

[Concept: Russell Conjugation](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27181)

> As the theory goes, it is not that we don’t have our own opinions so much as
> that we have too many contradictory ones, and it is generally our emotional
> state alone which determines on which ones we will predicate action or inaction.
>
> Russell Conjugation (or “emotive conjugation”) is a presently obscure
> construction from linguistics, psychology and rhetoric which demonstrates how
> our rational minds are shielded from understanding the junior role factual
> information generally plays relative to empathy in our formation of opinions.

> Where words can be considered “synonyms” if they carry the same factual content
> (I) regardless of the emotional content (II). This however leads to the peculiar
> effect that the synonyms for a positive word like “whistle-blower” cannot be
> used in its place as they are almost universally negative (with “snitch,”
> “fink,” “tattletale” being representative examples). This is our first clue that
> something is wrong, or at least incomplete with our concept of synonym requiring
> an upgrade to distinguish words that may be content synonyms but emotional
> antonyms.

- _firm_ vs _obstinate_ vs _pig-headed_
- _death tax_ vs _estate tax_
- _illegal alien_ vs _undocumented migrant_

[The Value is In The Tails](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/freWTrdfxwpn4imwn/the-value-is-in-the-tails)

> When I asked him why he bet on Trump, he said he didn't really understand

[Choosing The Zero Point](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rMfpnorsMoRwyn4iP/choosing-the-zero-point)

You can decide what state of affairs counts as neutral, and what counts as
positive or negative.

e.g. animal suffering: you can define the zero point as "animal shouldn't suffer
more than if humans were there" and if you accept it, that makes you a monster.
You could frame the zero point as the current situation, and every improvement
you make as a net gain.

[Creationism Unchallenged](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/05/28/creationism-unchallenged/)

Creationism was cancer and the most dangerous thing in the early 2000s. Yet
still as many people believe it. Yet we don't talk about anymore, and it's not
been an apocalypse. Talking about it hasn't hindered or helped.

Maybe it's the same with the issue of the day.
