[Last time][Four], I had just finished my cut and was dipping my toes in a new
program. In the time between then and now (6 months, no less!), I've not only
gotten up to speed on that program, I've also ran a modified "arms
specialization" variant block for 8 weeks, emphasized the training of muscles I
hadn't really trained directly before, and modified the program further by
integrating "Wenning warmups".

## New Program

Since September, I've been runing the [Stronger by Science Intermediate
Build][program] program. It's 5-spread (5 different workouts, each one per
week). In concrete terms, here what was I was doing:

[program]: https://my.builtwithscience.com/p/intermediate-build-program

---

### Upper Body Workout

- Bench Press (4x6)
- Chest-Supported Row (3x8)
- Standing Overhead Press (3x10)
- Lat Pulldown (3x12)
- High to Low Cable Flies (3x15)
- Lying Face Pulls (3x12)

### Lower Body Workout 1

- Front Squat (3x12)
- Deadlift (4x8)
- Barbell Hip Thurst (4x12)
- Single Leg Weighted Calf Raise (3x8)
- Leg Press Calf Raise (3x12)

### Push Workout

- Incline Dumbelle Press (3x10)
- Flat Dumbelle Press (RPT: 8, 10, 12)
- Lateral Cable Raises (2x12)
- Lateral Dumbbell Raises (2x12)
- Banded Push-Ups (2 to failure)
- Overhead Triceps Rope Extensions (3x15)
- Bar Triceps Pushdowns (3x12)

### Pull Workout

- Weighted Pull-Ups (RPT: 6, 8, 10)
- Seated Row (3x10)
- Reverse Pec Deck (3x12)
- Kneeling Face Pulls (4x15)
- Incline Dumbell Curls (3x10)
- Hammer Curls (3x10)
- Scapular Pull-Ups (2 to failure)

### Lower Body Workout 2

- Back Squat (3x8, 1x10 slow eccentric)
- Bulgarian Split Squat (4x10)
- Glute Ham Raise (4x12)
- Smith Machine Calf Raises (3x15)
- Seated Weight Calf Raise (3x15)

Notes:

- RPT stands for "reverse pyramidal training" and it means you lower the
  weight on the bar for each successive sets (but the reps go up). 
  
- The reps listed are a maximum but it's generally allowed to do 2 less if
  you're doing 6-10 reps and 4-5 less if you're doing 12-15 reps. The point
  being to allow for *double progression* (increase reps, then increase weight
  and lower reps, repeat).
  
- The program includes many more things, including warmup routines (mostly
  [dynamic stretches]) that I ran for a while, before time constraint got in the
  way. There are also *specialization phases* that I'll talk about later.
  
- You can see how much I lift on all of those, and how much I progressed in
  [Annex 1] at the bottom of this article.

Okay, so you might be thinking "that's a lot of stuff!". And indeed, it is.

I finished writing my thesis in early August, and between September and December
(when started my new job), I had a lot of time available. This enabled me to
effectively work out 5 times a week (sometimes 6, adding an extra session for
abs and traps, more on that later) and for a solid 1:45-2:00.

I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to maintain the rythm with a job, but
with a few troubled periods (business travel, Christmas holidays), I was able to
keep training mostly almost 5 times a week. The sessions did take a hit however,
as I more often than not cut them slightly shorter.

So what do I think about the program?

In general, it's a pretty solid and well-rounded program. I mostly like the
exercise selection. I also think it's too much volume: training 5 x 1.5 hours
per week is just too much, and often it took me even longer. Of course I could
modulate the weights and my effort to be done faster. Though, honestly, just
counting the sets + prescribed rest times, it would be pretty difficult.

Since it's so well-rounded, it's hard to know what to drop, but there were a few
obvious choices for me. First, the bulgarian split squat (in lower workout 1).
Everybody hates this exercise, but it's also awkardly positionned right after
the back squat. If the back squat is done seriously (all 4x8+ reps!), there is
no way that doing the split squat straight after is going to be that productive.
If anything, do it first with very light weights, as a warmup.

I also dropped the front squat. What can I say, I just don't like it. It's
either super unstable or hard on the wrists depending on your grip. The
rationale for doing it over a back squat is minimal (just a bit more variety).
But similarly, this is on the same day as the deadlift. I don't think that it's
a great idea to do some high-volume heavy deadlifting and some high-volume heavy
squating on the same day. Maybe that's just me though, but doing those to the
best of my ability is really taxing in a way that, for instance, the bench press
isn't.

That does leave me squatting only once a week when I used to squat thrice a week
(on every workout in StrongLifts!). Since I am making progress, I am fine with
it though. And legs weren't particularly my priority during that period (or
really, in general).

There is also a lot of calf exercises for not entirely clear reasons. It was
quite fun to train my calves, as that was a wholly untrained muscle for me. But
with more pressure on my time, I simply decide to do only one exercise per lower
body session. Mostly I'm doing the seated weight raises and the leg presses.
Might swap something else for the leg presses when I plateau there.

In a cinch, I'll also jettison the lying face pull (feels a bit gimmicky, and
there is already a kneeling face pull in the pull workout). Banded push-ups
often get *das boot* (and when I do it at the end of a well-filled push workout,
they really don't feel that useful). I tend to replace the hammer curls (in the
pull workout) with barbell curls (optionally making it a drag curl).

Other exercises are also sometimes dropped in favour of the Wenning warmups. But
more on that later.

## Discovering New Muscles

Since I had a lot of time at the start of that new program, I would sometimes
extend my workouts (or schedule extra workouts) with extra ab, glutes, and later
traps, lower back and forearms work.

Compared to my strength in the big compound lifts (in particular the squat and
deadlift), my abs, glutes and (possibly) lower back had been criminally
neglected. As for traps, they're not that important, but it actually felt good
to train them â€” it reduces the strain on them (traps tense very easily for me).
Forearm works mostly help with hanging exercises, and to stabilize the
bench/dumbbell press.

As for the actual content of these workouts, I experimented with the ab workout
as part of the intermediate build program, and [this Athlean-X ab
workout][ath-abs] ([video][ath-abs-vid]), ultimately converging on that. It's
actually two ab workout in one: a beginner and an advanced version.

There are seemingly an infinite amount of ab exercises, and you can find already
find a [varied selection] on the Athlean-X channel, but what's good about that
one in particular is that it outlines the different muscles and movement
patterns to hit to piece together a complete ab workout.

[ath-abs]: https://athleanx.com/articles/abs-for-men/the-perfect-abs-workout
[ath-abs-vid]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk97w6ZmV90
[varied selection]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=athlean-x+ab+workout

I progressed a good deal, to the point I'm now able to perform 15 relatively good form
leg raises, though it's frankly not my favorite exercise, as while quite taxing
for the abs, it's one of those exercise where you can really power through as
the other muscles take over quite fast. Also just hanging for the duration is
not so easy.

For the glutes, two exercises I recommand are the [resistance band crab
walk][crab] and the [glute pull through] (I've mostly run a variation where you
essentially do a wide squat while holding the rope in a similar position, but
the form presented in that video actually seems better).

[glute pull through]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbSF7ipBh5Y
[crab]: https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a753007/resistance-band-crab-walk/

For the traps, besides the traditional shrugs (and variants: monkey shrugs,
overhead shrugs), you can sample from [this video][traps] (I've personally used
the cross-cable trap raise).

[traps]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYPDveEb1RQ

Regarding the lower back, the stories is more complicated. I always assumed it
was quite strong as my very heavy deadlifts and squats tended to tax it quite a
bit. Those were in poor form, and the theory was that the strong lower back took
over, being not sufficiently assisted by e.g. glutes and abs. But this lower
back pain (purely muscular in nature) could also have been a sign that the
lower back was too weak. Hitting it directly with back extensions showed it
certainly wasn't as strong there as I would have expected. In fact [it seems
it's pretty weak for most people][lower-weak].

I now train the lower back with [back extensions] and [reverse hypers using an
incline bench][reverse hypers]

[lower-weak]: https://builtwithscience.com/lower-back-exercises/
[back extensions]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph3pddpKzzw
[reverse hypers]: https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19520414/reverse-hyper/

For the forearms, I've mixed exercises form [this Athlean-X video][ath-forearms]
with exercises from [this Build with Science video][bws-forearms].

[ath-forearms]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej4WzltO1DA
[bws-forearms]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XS0j1Gtobw

Unfortunately, working these auxiliary muscles muscles (especially the abs,
traps and forearms) has a bit fallen by the wayside as I am more pressed for
time these days. I just can't fit them in other workouts, so I end up sometimes
doing a special abs/trap workout, though that of course lengthens the whole
workout rotation. Glute and lower back work I integrated directly in the lower
body workouts, now as Wenning warmups.

## Arms Specialization

Part of the intermediate build program are a number of *specialization phases*
where you put emphasis on a certain body part. I've only run one of those: the
arms one, as that was a muscle group I really wanted to build up.

This post will end very long, so I'm going to describe the routine in precise
terms. Let's suffice to say it did not alter the base workout fundamentally, but
added a few more biceps/triceps exercises, including some [supersets], as well
as introducing narrow-grip bench presses. It makes place for this by cutting a
few exercises (two or three on the whole workout rotation) and a few sets on
others.

[supersets]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_training#Superset

My execution was not incredible. The specialization is meant to last 8 weeks (I
ended up doing 9) and overlapped a one-week business abroad, and a few days of
sickness. Still, I felt good activation over the duration, and was consequently
pretty satisfied with the experience.

I feel like my arms, and in particular the triceps on which I placed a
particular emphasis during the specialization and afterwards, progressed nicely.

It's hard to tell however. Sure, the lifted weights are going up, and so is my
body weight. But visually, it's hard to tell. I'm not taking physique pictures,
nor measuring arms circumference. Maybe I should do these things. But it's even
more time and energy invested in this.

I will have more to say about tracking training outcomes in the [Results]
section below.

[Results]: #results

## Wenning Warmups

Another change I made in my training (since mid-January) is that I started
incorporating so-called [Wenning warmups] ([lower body version][wenning-lower]):
basically do three exercises for 4 sets of 25 each, with a fast tempo at the
start of your workout. One exercise should mimic the movement pattern of the
main lift of the day, while the other two are in general used to work on weak
points (glute, hamstrings, lats, triceps, ...).

[Wenning warmups]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o61dLV9ccXA
[wenning-lower]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csm3FrSMPPs

I tried it because it was so simple to try out, but I ended up loving it. Matt
Wenning says this should take 12-15 minutes, but I hardly ever get it done under
20 (I probably could by lowering the weights, but I kinda like stretching it a
bit to progress).

My lifts have been going up since I started implemented this, though to be
honest it may have been some other factors at play. In any case, this kind of
high-volume warmup will probably stay a fixture of my training in the future.

## Results

Over the period, my bodyweight rose from 84kg in September to about 90kg now.
I've been bulking using a 300 calories surplus daily surplus which is about 10%
of my average calories intake (less on workout days, more on rest days). I've
erred on the side of more, but I certainly haven't gone about 400 daily calories
on average.

It's often said that intermediate lifter can take about 0.5lb of muscle (or at
least, mass) per week, so about a kilogram per month. With 6kg taken, I'm right
in the numbers. Indubitably, I've taken some fat as well, though I'm not sure
how much. I think going into my next cut I want to track fat with tape
measurements + the gym's impedance scale.

In terms of strength, it's hard to say what the results are. The main lifts have
gone up from their initial "reset" value when I switched to higher-volume,
lower-weight. The full data is in [Annex 1] below, but in summary my bench went
from 82.5 to 90kg (4x6), my squat from 90 to 110kg (3x80 + 1x90@90%) and my
deadlift from 110 to 127.5kg (4x8).

These numbers do not tell a complete story though. The starting numbers were
determined via a rep-max calculator, and then diminished significantly after
experimentation. This made sense since the calculator only worked for one-set
maxes. Still, it is possibly I could have started heavier. I also got much less
training on the big lifts than I used to â€” only once a week (and more
realistically, maybe only once every 8.5 days or so in recent days).

The progression was not linear either: most of these lifts were deloaded at
least once. In fact, I didn't remember this, but apparently I deloaded all three
main lifts right at the time when I started incorporating Wenning warmups into
my routine (mid-January), and they've been growing since.

So did I gain strength? The only way to know for sure will be to retry lifting
using my previous "settings" and see if the weights can go up. I probably want
to start doing 1-rep-max testing from time to time, to assess progress. I fully
expect I'll be able to reclaim my former level, but whether I will have gained
much is a question that hangs up in the hair. I have definitely worked on some
weak muscles and in general got a good amount of quality reps in, so I'm
hopeful.

But at the same time, I only practiced the big lifts once a week. If I were
focused on meaningful progress there, it should probably be ramped up to at
least twice.

Physically speaking, I'm not very changed. If I was taking pictures I could
perhaps notice small changes, but nothing that is going to be visible to an
observer that saw me 6 months ago. This is somewhat disappointing, but it is
life. I expect the best change I can do right now is becoming significantly
leaner.

## Thoughts

I've already given my thoughts on the Intermediate build program above. But
aside from that, what have I learned from this period?

First, it was good to adopt a more well-rounded approach that includes more
muscles and weaknesses. The flip side was training big lifts only once per week.
This in turns means slower progress, but otherwise I was relatively fine with
it. I'm at a point in the road where I have to choose priorities more clearly,
and I think I will prioritize a more well-rounded bodybuilding-inspired type
approach, as opposed to chasing number of the big lifts, powerlifting-style.

It was good in the sense of fixing underlying weaknesses and improving physique
(while my physique progressed little in the past six month, the whole paradigm
shift started with adopting Jeremy Ethier's [full body workout] [a year
ago][Three] and I certainly saw results from that). It's also good because I
enjoy it. I enjoyed [StrongLifts] too, but I think that returning to it (or to
other hyper-focused powerlifting programs) would leave me wanting for something
else.

[full body workout]: https://builtwithscience.com/best-full-body-workout/
[StrongLifts]: https://stronglifts.com/

A problem that surfaces however, is that of time management. 5 workouts a week
for 2 hours is simply too much. Even now that I'm somewhat cutting things to 1.5
hours most workouts, it's still a lot. And accessory works on abs and traps has
fallen to the wayside. The Wenning warmups did not help with keeping the time
down (but that was mostly compensated by more cuts).

It's not entirely clear to me what the solution is yet, but it will probably
involve some kind of shifting focus. I've been reading up on "Reactive Training
Systems" (aka RTS, more on that below) and it proposes to use training blocks (of
individually-determined length, but typically 6-10 weeks) with shifting
approaches, to see what works and what doesn't. This would also be a perfect
opportunity to shift one's focus while some other area stay in maintenance mode.

I also need to run deload weeks from time to time. I've done it once or twice
since last time, but I only do it when I really feel the need, which is probably
too late and very far from optimal. Again, RTS may provide an answer here.

## The Future

I've had a couple ideas for the future. First, I want to redo smaller sets with
heavy weights, if only because I want to see what the last 6 months have gained
me in terms of strength. Maybe double up the frequency of the big lifts in order
to see some progress.

The other big thing to do is to cut again, and hopefully go under what I reached
last time in terms of bodyfat percent.

I also want to change the way I approach my programming, using Reactive Training
Systems (RTS) to program blocks and experiment. See the [RTS section] below. As
such, training heavy compound lifts twice a week could be a dedicated block. The
cut, on the other hand, would necessarily span multiple blocks. This is
annoying, as one will necessarily not see the best results during a cut, but
somewhat necessary.

[RTS section]: #reactive-training-systems-rts

All that is well and lofty, but for the time being we have to compose with the
coronavirus which caused all the gyms to shut down for at least two weeks here
in Belgium (and probably more). I'm of a mind to make the most of it and get
all-in on home workout. I've ordered two sets of reconfigurable 2-24kg dumbells,
but I plan to do mostly bodyweight work.

Actually, I experimented with bodyweight training once a few months ago â€”
unwilling to drive to drive to a 24/7 gym, I cobbled up a push-up/chest workout.
It was much rougher than I expected and my arms probably got the sorest they've
ever been as a result. So naturally, I'm quite excited about getting to try
similar things again!

In terms of particular muscle group, I think I need to keep training my lower
back. I'm also starting to wonder whether I shouldn't do some quadriceps
isolation. This is usually a strong muscle for most people, but it sure seems to
be a bottleneck on the squat for me.

Other things I'm considering for the some future are doing full body weight
training each day (mix upper and lower body during each session). This could be
done as supersets and could help drive the workout time down. The trick would be
to preserve or even increase volume under this new regime.

I also want to keep paying attention to the small things and in particular
emphasize the [eccentric] part of my lifts.

[eccentric]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_training

## Reactive Training Systems (RTS)

I learned about Reactive Training Systems through the [Stronger by Science]
podcast, though the best introduction is probably this [Powerlifting to Win
review] of the system as well as [this article on
autoregulation][autoregulation].

[Strong by Science]: https://www.strongerbyscience.com/
[Powerlifting to Win review]: https://www.powerliftingtowin.com/a-review-of-mike-tuchscherers-reactive-training-systems-rt/sg
[autoregulation]: https://www.powerliftingtowin.com/autoregulation/

I've also started going through the articles on the [official website][rts] to
see what I could glean.

[rts]: https://articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com/

In this section I want to highlight a few neat ideas (probably the main ideas)
from the system. These all relate to the key idea of *autoregulation*: instead
of prescribing an absolute amount of sets/reps/weights, one should instead
ensure a certain amount of effort is exerted. Effort can vary greatly from day
to day, depending on rest, energy level, stress, ... By prescribing a set amount
of effort rather than fixed volume, you will ensure you do enough work to make
progress regardless of your condition.

### RPE

RPE stands for rate of perceived exertion and its a way to qualify the effort
put into a set. Here is a handy chart:

![Flowchart describing RPE values from 5.5 to 10](rpe-description.jpg)

In practice, it's rare to use RPE values of under 8.

There are multiple ways to "use" RPE. A simple way is to find out how much
weight you should put on the bar. You fix the number of sets and the rep count
(or rep range) and then your goal is to lift the heaviest weight for which you
can attain the given RPE.

Another way is to fix the weight but keep performing reps until you reach the
desired RPE. Doing that with a RPE of 10 is the classic "repeat to failure"
scheme.

Those are both example of autoregulation! Personally, I've tended to stick to
much to a certain number of reps, when I could have done more, and I've also had
the tendency to feel disappointed when I fell short, while at the same time
feeling I'd put in a tremendous effort. In that light, the idea of RPE was
helpful to me, and I've made good use of it (though to be honest, most often by
simply going to failure on accessory lifts).

Yet, I have reservations about RPE. First, it's difficult to evaluate. RTS is
mostly about powerlifting, and it's true it's easier to estimate RPE in heavy,
compound movements (and interestingly for me, it's easier to tell on the bench
press than on the squat and easier on the squat than on the deadlift). But even
on those heavy movement, I can generaly tell when my last rep is (i.e. not
attempt a rep that would be a failure) and *maybe* tell when I have one rep left
in reserve (sometimes people use the acronym RIR for "rep in reserve"), but not
more. I haven't really trained that capacity, but I'm dubious.

In fact, on some exercises, I can hardly tell if I'm doing reps in good form at
all (this was my big frustration on the [barbell Pendlay row] that was part of
StrongLifts.

[barbell Pendlay row]: https://stronglifts.com/barbell-row/

On bodybuilding-type exercises (isolations etc) with higher rep counts (12-15...
sometimes more) it's also hard to tell. There also typically is the issue of
form degradation. It's usually okay for the last reps not to look academic, but
how sloppy is too sloppy?

My big take away from RPE is: set in advance the effort you want to get (to
failure? some reps in reserve? maybe first few sets with reps in reserve than to
failure on last set?) and performs reps accordingly.

But RPE can also be used in other ways, which we'll talk about soon.

### Fatigue

The concept of fatigue is another way to tackle autoregulation. Whereas RPE can
be used to modulate the number of reps, fatigue is used (in conjunction with
RPE) to modulate the number of sets.

Here's how it works: you set a fatigue amount in % (say 5%). Then you have two
options.

1. Load drops. You work your way to a top heavy set (usually your max for a
   given rep count & RPE). You then drop the fatigue percent, and keep
   performing sets with the same rep count until you reach the same rep count.
   
   Example:
   ```
    - 90kg   Ã—5 @7      (warmup)
    - 95kg   Ã—5 @8      (warmup)
    - 100kg  Ã—5 @9      (top set)
    - 95kg   Ã—5 @8      (drop 5%)
    - 95kg   Ã—5 @8.5
    - 95kg   Ã—5 @9      (fatigue reached)
    ```

2. Repeats. Instead of working your way up to a top heavy set, you pick some
   fixed weight under your max. You then repeat sets using this weight until you
   reach some pre-determined RPE. To determine the fatigue accrued from working
   up from the starting RPE to the final RPE, you consult an RPE chart like the
   one below and subtract the initial effort % from the final effort %.
   
   One rep at RPE 10 is your one-rep max, and thus 100% effort. Other
   combinations have their effort expression as some percentage of that. Note
   that this is a "stock" version of the chart, but it could differ from person
   to person (some are better in certain rep ranges, or even on certain lifts),
   so Mike Tuscherer (RTS' creator) encourages you to [customize your RPE
   chart].
   
   ![RPE chart: describe effort percent for RPE/number-of-reps pairs](rpe-chart.png)

[customize your RPE chart]: https://articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com/2016/01/06/customizing-your-rpe-chart/

### Blocks

RTS structures training in "blocks" and encourages you to experience different
things within a block.

You should closely monitor your first block to determine your "time to peak" â€”
the number of weeks after which you're likely to max out your lifts compared to
your starting weights. This is typically the same accross the big three
powerlifting lifts, although Tuchscherer warns that it can sometimes be
different. Progression being not always linear, your have to ensure you persist
long enough in your first blocks in order not to call it quits right before the
gains come in.

Once you know your time to peak, you can use it to schedule blocks of that
duration, followed by a couple deload weeks (typically 1/3 of the time to peak).

I like the idea of time-boxed blocks, though once again you have to note that
this is powerlifting approach. Doing each big lift only once a week, the
progress is likely to be slow (or blocks will be very long). And of course, I'm
a big fan of experimentation (while also believing you need to stick with
something long enough to be able to see progress).

But the idea of blocks might also be to shift your focus. So maybe instead I can
focus on improving my bench press, or the number of pullups I can do, and then I
ramp up the frequency of these movements and determine the block time
accordingly. This is not unlike the Build with Science "specialization phases",
although with clearer metrics.

Each block should be followed by few weeks of deload, so that's an easy way to
know when to schedule them.

## Annex 1: Lift Progress

Here are my stats for each of the exercises in the Built with Science
Intermediate Build program.

I've done exercises outside the program, and dropped some of these exercises
(some I dropped earlier haven't even been reported). The goal here is not to be
exhaustive, it is to provide an overview of my progress over the period.

For each exercise, I'm reporting:
- How much I lifted prior starting the program (if I did that exercise at all).
- How much I started lifting in the program.
- How much I peaked at (my record for the time I was on the program).
- How much I currently lift.
- Sometimes some extra comments.

### Upper Body Workout

- Bench Pess
    - **prior:** 3x100 + 2x3x92.5
    - **start:** 4x6x82.5
    - **peak/current:** 4x6x90
    - Exhibits a pattern of loading/deloading quite unlike my other lifts (three
      cycles). Should probably have done a deload week and gone back to the
      previously mastered weight.
    - Discovered that benching on a reverse incline bench (head down) is
      actually slightly easier and could (should?) be used to help build the
      normal bench press.

- Chest-Supported Row
    - **prior:** 3x15x65
    - **start:** 3x8x75
    - **peak:** 3x8x95
    - **current:** 3x8x90
    - Not done in February/March, mostly because I forgot :'(
    
- Overhead Press
    - **prior:** 4x3x62.5
    - **start:** 3x10x40
    - **current/peak:** 3x8x50
    - Slow but steady progression.
    
- Lat Pulldown

### Lower Body Workout 1

- Front Squat
    - **start:** 4x12x50
    - **peak:** 4x12x65
    - dropped (see above)

- Deadlift
    - **prior:** 3x150 (peak: 3x187.5 with sloppy form)
    - **start:** 4x8x110
    - **peak:** 4x8x127.5
    - **current:** 4x8x125
    - A lots of ups and downs on the way.
    - Experimented with hook grips.

- Hip Thrust
    - **prior/start:** 4x12x50
    - **peak:** 4x12x70
    - **current:** 4x12x60 (??)
    - Mostly dropped, too hard on the back for deadlift day.

- Single Leg Weighted Calf Raise
    - The numbers are all over the place for this one. Weight can vary wildly
      depending on platform height, positioning, support, range of motion, time
      under tension, ... I can probably do 3x10x28 with good form.
    - Dropped (see above).

- Leg press Calf Raise
    - **start:** 4x12x39
    - **peak/current:** 4x12x107
    - Probably started a bit underpowered.

### Push Workout

- Incline Dumbbell Press
    - **prior:** 3x10x34
    - **start/peak/current:** 34/32/30
    - Oh boy, I hadn't realized.
    - On the other hand, volume increased because it's now followed by the flat press.
    
- Flat Dumbbell Press
    - **start:** 10x28/10x28/12x26
    - **peak:** 8x34/6x32/11x30

- Cable Lateral Raise
    - **start:** 2x11x9
    - **peak/current:** 2x10x11.3
    
- Dumbbell Lateral Raise
    - **prior:** 3x9x10
    - **start:** 2x12x9
    - **peak:** 2x12x10
    - **current:** 2x11x8
    
- Banded Push-Up
    - **start:** 13/9
    - **peak:** 18/14
    - **last:** 14/10
    - I typically did this at the tail end of long workouts, so it mostly
      reflects my energy level that day and not much else.
    
- Overhead Triceps Rope Extensions
    - **start:** 3x15x23
    - **peak/current:** 3x15x41
    
- Bar Triceps Pushdown
    - **start:** 3x12x43.3
    - **peak/current:** (9/13/11)x56.3

### Pull Workout

- Weighted Pull-Ups
    - **prior:** 6x15/8x10/7x5
    - **start:** 6x12.5/8x7.5/7x5
    - **peak:** 6x15/8x12.5/8x10
    - **current:** 6x10/7x5/8x0
    - Actually started at a deload point.
    - It looks like regression, but you have to consider that I gained 6+ kilo
      in the interval. But this sure isn't progressing much either.

- Seated Row
    - **prior:** 
    - **start:** 3x10x47.3
    - **peak:** 10x70.6/2x10x68.3
    - **current:** (15/14/11)x56.6
    - **warmup:** 3x25x25/25x20.3
    - Had to deload this to get a better activation.
    - Feels even better as a Wenning warmup.

- Reverse Pec Deck
    - **start:** 3x12x59
    - **peak:** 3x12x79
    - **current:** 10x66/12x66/8x66
    - I varied the grip (pronated vs neutral), and the seat height, which give
      vastly different activations. Here too, more weight is not necessarily
      better if the activation isn't there.

- Kneeling Face Pulls ([Single Rope, Elbows-First Version][style1])
    - **prior/start:** 4x12x64 (peak: ~4x13x73)
    - **peak:** 2x15x68/2x12x68
    - Switched to the other kneeling face pull style

- Kneeling Face Pulls ([Dual Ropes, Hands-First Version][style2])
    - **start:** 3x16x18 (with overhead extension)
    - **peak:** 3x15x27 (with overhead extension)
    - **peak/current:** 3x24x41 (without overhead extension)
    - Dropped the accessory overhead extension to progress, but might
      reintroduce it, it's a great trap exercise.

- Incline Dumbell Curls
    - **start:** 3x10x10
    - **peak/current:** 8x14/8x12/11x10

- Hammer Curls
    - **start/peak:** 3x10x14
    - Not a huge fan of those, I replaced them with barbell curls.

- Scapular Pull-Ups
    - **start:** 2x10
    - **peak/current (?):** 20/18/10
    - This one is also a finisher, so numbers varied a bit but remained in the
      same area. Except for that last time where I feel like I *got* something
      about the exercise I didn't before... We'll see if it reproduces!
