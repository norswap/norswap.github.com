**Don't Try to be Smart, Avoid Idiocy**

---

> It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by
> trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very
> intelligent. There must be some wisdom in the folk saying "It’s the strong
> swimmers who drown."

---

> We try to profit from always remembering the obvious than from grasping the
> esoteric.

---

> Other people are trying to be smart, all I’m trying to be is non-idiotic. I’ve
> found that’s all you have to do to get ahead in life, be non-idiotic and live
> a long time. It’s harder to be non-idiotic than most people think.

---

> Organized common (or uncommon) sense is an enormously powerful tool. There are
> huge dangers with computers. People calculate too much and think too little.

---

> Use of the scientific method and effective checklists minimizes errors and
> omissions.

---

> Don't overlook the obvious by drowning in minutiae.

---

**Restrict Yourself to your Circle of Competence**

---

> Acknowledging what you don’t know is the dawning of wisdom.

---

> If we have a strength, it is in recognizing when we are operating well within
> our circle of competence and when we are approaching the perimeter.  
> — Warren Buffett

---

> Only in fairy tales are emperors told they are naked.

---

> If you try to predict the future of everything, you attempt too much. You’re
> going to fail through lack of specialisation.

---

> Mimicking the herd, invites regression to the mean.

---

> Above all, never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person
> to fool.

---

> You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are, If you play games where
> other people have the aptitudes and you don't, you're going to lose.

---

**Invert, Always Invert**

---

> Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it
> backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where don’t we want to go,
> and how do you get there? Instead of looking for success, make a list of how
> to fail instead. Tell me where I’m going to die, that is, so I don’t go there.

---

> I was greatly helped in my quest by two turns of mind. First, I had long
> looked for insight by inversion in the intense manner counseled by the great
> algebraist, Jacobi: "Invert, always invert." I sought good judgment mostly by
> collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such
> outcomes. Second, I became so avid a collector of instances of bad judgement
> that I paid no attention to boundaries between professional territories.

---

**Model Thinking**

---

> Just as multiple factors shape almost every system, multiple models from a
> variety of disciplines, applied with fluency, are needed to understand that
> system.

---

> The most important thing to keep in mind is the idea that especially big forces
> often come out of these one hundred models. When several models combine, you get
> lollapalooza effects; this is when two, three, or four forces are all operating
> in the same direction. And, frequently, you dont get simple addition. It's often
> like a critical mass in physics where you get a nuclear explosion if you get to
> a certain point of mass - and you dont ger anything much worth seeing if you
> don't reach the mass. Sometimes the forces just add like ordinary quantities and
> sometimes they combine on a breakpoint or critical-mass basis.
> 
> More commonly, the forces coming out of these one hundred models are
> conflicting to some extent. And you get huge, miserable tradeoffs. But if you
> can't think in terms of tradeoffs and recognize tradeoffs in what you're
> dealing with, you're a horse's patoot. You clearly are a danger to the rest of
> the people when serious thinking is being done. You have to recognize how
> these things combine.

---

> I've long believed that a certain system - which almost any intelligent person
> can learn - works way better than the systems that most people use. What you
> need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And, with that system,
> things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.

---

> Especially important examples of these models include the redundancy/backup
> system model from engineering, the compound interest model from mathematics,
> the breakpoint / tipping-moment / autocatalysis models from physics and
> chemistry, the modern Darwinian synthesis model from biology, and cognitive
> misjudgment models from psychology.

---

> Personally, I've gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First,
> what are the factors that really govern the interests invoked, rationally
> considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain
> at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions in various ways -
> which, by and large, are useful - but which often malfunction?

---

> How can smart people so often be wrong? They don't do what I'm telling you to
> do: use a checklist to be sure you get all the main models and use them
> together in a multimodular way.
