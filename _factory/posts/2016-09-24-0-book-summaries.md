title: "Book Summaries"
---

I like to read a lot, notably books about psychology, philosophy, and other
actionable topics. However, I often feel that these book dilute their ideas too
much, in order to make a "proper" (fat) book out of it.

But now, I have the cure. [This list of book summary websites][summaries] covers
a large range of books in the topics that interest me.

Here's a copy of the list for posterity:

- [Deconstructing Excellence](http://www.deconstructingexcellence.com/)
- [Derek Sivers' Books Read](https://sivers.org/book)
- [Farnam Street](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/)
- [4 Minute Books](http://fourminutebooks.com/all-summaries/)
- [Actionable Books](http://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/)
- [Blinkist (paid)](https://app.blinkist.com/en/library/)

The first four websites are great, but the selection is limited.

Actionable Books has a lot of things, but the summaries only include 3/4 bullet
points and sometimes fail to capture the essence of the book, as far as I've
seen.

Blinkist seemed like the most well-rounded option. I made a trial account and
was quite satisfied with the two summaries I read.
