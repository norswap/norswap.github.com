[The Categories Were Made For Man, Not Man For The Categories](
https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/)

This cannot be summarized in full, but it is a joy to read, and comes with an
important lesson for your arguments and debates.

Nevertheless, the key takeaway, and a taste:

There are a series of disputes on categories, which are really disputes on the
definition of the category. (Is a whale a fish? Is gender dysphoria a mental
illness?)

In reality, multiple definitions often makes sense. The key being to pick the
right one for the task at hand. An alternative categorization system is not an
error. You draw category boundaries in specific ways to capture tradeoffs you
care about.

The (controversial) hair dryer incident:

> This one obsessive compulsive woman would drive to work every morning and
> worry she had left the hair dryer on and it was going to burn down her house.
> So she’d drive back home to check that the hair dryer was off, then drive back
> to work, then worry that maybe she hadn’t really checked well enough, then
> drive back, and so on ten or twenty times a day [...] to the point where her
> career was in a downspin and she thought she would have to quit and go on
> disability. [...]
>
> She’d seen countless psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors, she’d
> done all sorts of therapy, she’d taken every medication in the book, and none of
> them had helped. [...]
>
> So she came to my hospital and was seen by a colleague of mine, who told her
> “Hey, have you thought about just bringing the hair dryer with you?”
>
> And it worked.

> Musashi is quoted as saying:
>
> > The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut
> > the enemy, whatever the means. Whenever you parry, hit, spring, strike or touch
> > the enemy’s cutting sword, you must cut the enemy in the same movement. It is
> > essential to attain this. If you think only of hitting, springing, striking or
> > touching the enemy, you will not be able actually to cut him.
>
> Likewise, the primary thing in psychiatry is to help the patient, whatever the
> means. Someone can concern-troll that the hair dryer technique leaves
> something to be desired in that it might have prevented the patient from
> seeking a more thorough cure that would prevent her from having to bring the
> hair dryer with her. But compared to the alternative of “nothing else works”
> it seems clearly superior.

[If You’re Busy, You’re Doing Something Wrong: The Surprisingly Relaxed Lives of Elite Achievers](

> The time diaries revealed that both groups (elite and average players) spent, on
> average, the same number of hours on music per week (around 50).

> The elite players were spending almost three times more hours than the average
> players on deliberate practice — the uncomfortable, methodical work of
> stretching your ability.

> The average players, they discovered, spread their work throughout the day. The
> elite players, by contrast, consolidated their work into two well-defined
> periods (two peaks: in the morning and in the afternoon).

> The elite players slept an hour more per night than the average players. The
> elite players were significantly more relaxed than the average players.

Hard work (delibrate practice) vs hard to do work (draining, busy).

> The solution suggested by this research, as well as my own, is as simple as it
> is startling: Do less. But do what you do with complete and hard focus. Then
> when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of the day.

> Performance coach, with a bent towards sports, surgery, and executive

> The best in every business do what they have learned to do without questioning

> high-performance state of mind the “Trusting Mindset.”

> You cannot pull up all those years of education, training, and experience in

> Different, in fact, as you and a squirrel running across a telephone wire!

> Put a two-by-four board on the floor and walk from one end to the other. It is

> Success depends on emptying your head rather than filling it.

> I actually have recommended to some clients to create even more chaos at work

> Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability and
> determination. But there's a third ingredient that's not as well understood:
> an obsessive interest in a particular topic.

> When you look at the lives of people who've done great work, you see a
> consistent pattern. They often begin with a bus ticket collector's obsessive
> interest in something that would have seemed pointless to most of their
> contemporaries. One of the most striking features of Darwin's book about his
> voyage on the Beagle is the sheer depth of his interest in natural history. His
> curiosity seems infinite. Ditto for Ramanujan, sitting by the hour working out
> on his slate what happens to series.
>
> But there is a difference between Ramanujan and a bus ticket collector. Series
> matter, and bus tickets don't.
>
> It's a mistake to think they were "laying the groundwork" for the discoveries
> they made later. There's too much intention in that metaphor. Like bus ticket
> collectors, they were doing it because they liked it.
>
> If I had to put the recipe for genius into one sentence, that might be it: to
> have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.
>
> Aren't I forgetting about the other two ingredients? Less than you might
> think. An obsessive interest in a topic is both a proxy for ability and a
> substitute for determination. Unless you have sufficient mathematical
> aptitude, you won't find series interesting. And when you're obsessively
> interested in something, you don't need as much determination: you don't need
> to push yourself as hard when curiosity is pulling you.

> But there are some heuristics you can use to guess whether an obsession might
> be one that matters. For example, it's more promising if you're creating
> something, rather than just consuming something someone else creates. It's
> more promising if something you're interested in is difficult, especially if
> it's more difficult for other people than it is for you.

> But you can never be sure. In fact, here's an interesting idea that's also
> rather alarming if it's true: it may be that to do great work, you also have
> to waste a lot of time.

[Consistency is The Key](http://tynan.com/thekey)

> The most productive people I know are people who absolutely master the basics.

> have, and they know how to string those days together in such a way that

>
> The most important basic skill to master, without a doubt, is consistency.
> Those who are able to be consistent end up with huge success, very often much
> greater success than they expected or even hoped for.
>
> People in finance say that people aren't able to comprehend the benefits of
> compounding interest over time. Consistency in productivity creates compound
> benefits which people are similarly not able to comprehend. Your starting
> point doesn't matter, because you can quickly scale up to your capacity once
> you have a history and habit of consistency.
>
> Let's say you wanted to write a book. Maybe you'd tried and failed before. If
> you commit to writing for thirty minutes every day for a month, you'll write
> at least 10 to 15 thousand words. Not bad. Then the next month you up your
> quota to just one hour. Now you have a cumulative 30 to 45 thousand words. Not
> quite a book yet, but you're a month away.
>
> And how easy does that process sound? Anyone can do half an hour a day. Anyone
> who has done a half hour a day for a month can do an hour a day. And anyone
> who has done an hour a day can do another month.

> Interestingly, it doesn't seem to matter what you choose to be consistent on
> or how easy or difficult it is. I've experimented a lot with this, and even
> the easiest tasks lead to a positive spiral of consistency. I've found that as
> soon as I get a coaching client to be consistent with any tasks relevant to
